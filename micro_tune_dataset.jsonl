Then they obviously had another toll behind the screen. However, after that, they secretly take away one of the tolls. When they raise the screen back up, there is only one toll there. When the researchers observed the baby's eye movement that they had recorded during the experiment, they found that the baby stared when it saw only one toll, since babies usually stare at what surprises them. We can conclude the baby's prize because the baby knew that one plus one equals two and had expected two tolls when it saw only one.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "001", "audio_file": "1_12.mp3"}}

They first, they're using an experiment to prove that. They first let the kids just see one dough and had an after a screen. Then they show the kids another dough and also had it behind the screen. So this then the secretly took away one dough and moved the screen. So the baby can only see one one dough. So the baby are actually surprised by saying one dough because he or she is expecting two doughs after the screen. So the researcher recorded the baby's eye movement and provided evidence that they're shocked because they stare at the place, they stare at the door and they're showing they're surprised by the situation.

Then they obviously add another door behind the screen. However, after that, they successfully take away one of the doors. So when they raise the screen, back up, there is only one door there. When the researchers observe the baby's eyes, the movement that they had recorded during the experiment, they found that the baby is there when it saw only one door.

As long as young as 5 years old, those babies can add things up. They can do some basic calculations like adding and multiplying. Although there are not indirect evidence, indirect evidence shows that the babies of such kind really have those capabilities. In the experiment, the babies show in front of the door, and then the door was hidden behind the screen. Later, the second door was shown in front of the baby, and the door was also hidden behind the screen. What the baby doesn't know is that the scientists secretly take one door away. The baby expects to see one, but the result is, they are really surprised. So it was captured by the camera, and because baby becomes stars, so the result is quite removing.

However, it's hard to determine whether this hypothesis is right or not, because you can't ask those babies who even can't speak to any calculation. Finally, researchers come up with ideas. They put two dogs in front of the babies and hide them behind. The researchers took away one of the dogs to observe babies' altitude. You know, there should be two dogs, but only one dog remained. If you can tell, you will be confused or surprised. The baby stares at the remaining dogs, which is believed to be a signal of surprise, according to several stories.

So a bunch of researchers come up with this plan that they put a doll in front of some babies so they can see it is there and then they lower the screen to hide the doll from them. Then obviously put another doll in front of the baby but behind the screen the baby would expect two dolls there. But instead they actually secretly remove one doll so there will be only one doll behind the screen.

In the experiments, a dough is shown in two babies, and the screen is lowest, which will prevent the dough with the baby from seeing that dough. And then, the second dough is obviously seen through the baby and placed behind the screen. Then the baby expects that there are two doughs behind the screen. Secretively, they took away one dough and raised the screen, and the baby will be surprised of that, because it originally expressed two doughs, but now it's only one doughs.

He picks up someone's narrative. It goes like plenty of room for friends, plenty of rooms for families, plenty of room for everyone. With the repeated message, people who haven't watched the commercial now believe that the car is roomy even though it's not. Another strategy is to get a celebrity to advertise a product because people are more likely to accept or come by someone they are near like a celebrity. So if a car commercial hires a famous U.S. car driver as his spokesman, then we would also be convinced that the car is very fast even though it's not fast at all.", "output": "4.1分", "meta": {"problem_id": "003", "audio_file": "1_01.mp3"}}

The first one is repetition and the second one is the use of the celebrity. Repeated information used to make it possible for the receiver to understand the meaning more, thoroughly and carefully, and also can see the product in a positive light. For example, in a roomy car commercial, the driver stopped the car at different times and said, plenty room for friends, plenty room for family, plenty room for everybody. Repeated for several times so the people would like to believe the car's really big, but actually this is only a small car. And in the second strategy is the using of the celebrity because the words of the famous people are used to trustworthy and people would like to believe the word set by the famous people. Like a famous race car driver said, I like my car's fast. If the car is not very expensive or with a low performance rating, people always believe this is super fast a car because they are influenced by the famous race car driver.", "output": "3.8分", "meta": {"problem_id": "003", "audio_file": "1_03.wav"}}

The first one is the repetition strategy when repeat exposure to message. The professor gives an example about a car commercial company when they use an advertisement by repeating the sentences of the Romy car and show to people how they drive the Romy car and pick up different people and a variety of people. So each time they said there is a plenty of people's room, even though the car doesn't be big enough, but they pursue the people that buy repeating and repetition the sentences that it is a Romy car. And the second strategy is by getting a celebrity to advertise, by using famous people to advertise about the car and show to people that it is car how it's passed, even though the car doesn't fast.

First one is repetition. There is an advertisement for a small vehicle. And in this advertisement, a man is driving a car and picking up several people at the time. And every time he picks up the people and the narrator would say, oh, there are still plenty of room there. So the audience may be convinced that this small car is actually spacious. And the second one is using celebrity to promote their products. Because people tend to accept the products, you know, promoted by someone that is appealing and personally admired. Because people tend to think this celebrity is trustworthy. For example, if a race car driver is promoting a car that is actually inexpensive with low rating, people will still believe that this is a good car and they should buy it.

For example, if people are exposed to the message repeatedly, they will accept it or see it positively. For example, in a car advertisement, which publicizes the car is quite roomy. And the driver keeps picking up more people on the road. And every time the narrator will set something like plenty of room for everyone. So since the message has been repeated a lot, people will have a sense that this is a quite special call. So it actually looks very small. And you think people might reach a conclusion that slogan is incorrect. But at the end, people will be convinced. And the second strategy is to use some celebrity to publicize the products. For example, people will accept some claims made by famous people whom they admire. For example, if a risk car driver does something that like I like my car faster, people will actually believe that this is a very cheap, low performance car.

The first one is that if people are peacefully exposed to a messaging, then the people are going to actually believe in that messaging. In a car commercial, which sells so-called Rumi car, the car serves multiple times to pick up different people and the advertisement goes like plenty of room for friends and plenty of room for families. And then the customers were going to think this is actually a very spacious car instead of saying this is a very misdescribed advertisement. And the second way to do it is to ask a celebrity to present it because people would think celebrities tend to be trustworthy. So you can ask a well known racing driving people to present a car and he would say something like, I like my cars fast. And then the customers were saying the car they sell is actually very fast.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "003", "audio_file": "1_08.wav"}}

There are two strategies. First is to repeat as much as possible. Take a TV commercial of roomy cars as an example. In the advertisements, the driver driving around the car and taking six, three to four pea holes and repeated the words plenty rooms for everyone, plenty rooms, and even if the car, in fact, is not big enough, the customers are convinced that the car is big enough to carry more people. The second is the celebrity. People often accept by famous people and they are appealing and admiring. Take a car advertisements as an example too.

For example, you can let them start to drive a car and while saying I like the car red first, so people will easily believe that the car can red at a very high speed.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "003", "audio_file": "1_17.mp3"}}

First is by repetition. Even a slogan is meaningless or untrue. It makes us see it in a positive light. The professor uses the example of roomy car to illustrate. A car stops now and then to pick up some people and at every time the narrator says, plenty for friends, plenty for family, plenty for everyone. So even the car is seemingly small. It convinced us that it's much more spacious. Second is to find some celebrity to advertise products because within those advertisements are more trustworthy and appealing. For example, if a risk car driver advertises a car, even a car is just planned or some inexpensive vehicle with low performance rates, we'll think this car is maybe fast because we are convinced.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "003", "audio_file": "1_18.mp3"}}

For example, when people are exposed to repeated the message, they tend to accept it, even though it is untrue sometimes. For example, in a car commercial, the slogan keeps the same, a roomy car, plenty of room for everybody. Even though people know that the car is not that big enough, they might still have a sense that this is a spacious car. That is to say, even the slogan is untrue and misrepresent the product. People still believe it, and I convinced that last. The second strategy is to use celebrities to publicize the product, because people tend to believe famous people. For instance, if a famous race car driver publicizes the car as really fast and that he loves the car for his speed, even though people realize that the car is very cheap and with low performance, they might be convinced that the car is impressed for his speed at the end.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "003", "audio_file": "1_19.wav"}}

The second one is the celebrity strategy. People who will actually think the celebrity or famous people is actually trustworthy than the chewed.

The first one is repetition, which is a key factor, a key strategy in advertising. You repeat something meaningless or untrue again and again. People begin to accept it.

Even though the car looks kind of small, that customer will get a feeling that it's quite spacious inside. So they will take that slogan and represent the product.

There are two strategies relating to this purpose, why it's to repeat the same concept over and over again. It can sometimes be done in a subtle way, that for example there is a small car but the advertiser keeps saying this is spacious and it is plenty room for everybody, plenty room for your friends and family. And you start to believe this is true even though if you look at the car directly it's actually small but it works. Another strategy is to have a celebrity to advocate for your product.

For example, red is a strong color, and artists use it to evoke strong emotions like big joy, excitement, or even the anger. Two color has the calming effect on people. Another one is the texture of a painting, and visual illusion created by the artist like roughness and softness. This can also evoke different emotions.

Firstly, she mentions that there were different colors that can convey different things, such as red, which is a strong color, and it can express extreme joy, excitement, and well as anger. However, on the other hand, blue is a comforting sense, give people a sense of smoothness. And there's also texture, give people a feel of work. It can be visual in the artist's work to create kind of illusion. So, there's a rough, which means strength, and smooth is more comforting. Let's take a painting as an example, which use a lot of strong colors, such as red and orange, and it uses brush to strokes. And this gives people kind of a sense of rough and wildness, as long as it is also gives people a sense of chaotic, and that is the importance of visual elements in painting.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "004", "audio_file": "1_02.mp3"}}

The first one is color. Different color can convey different senses or feelings. For example, red color can evoke strong emotions such as extreme joy or excitement or even anger, while blue color may have a common effect on its viewers. The second one is texture, which means the surface quality of the world. A rough texture can evoke strong feelings, while a smooth texture may seem less emotional. Artists usually combine these visual elements together to convey a message of the world. For example, a painting with strong colors such as red and orange, as well as white-brown brush strokes, which suggest a rough texture, may look much more wild and chaotic than a painting, with tiny smooth brush strokes as well as soft pale colors.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "004", "audio_file": "1_03.wav"}}

For instance, a rough texture evokes strong motion and it represents the strength, where a softer texture is more calming and less emotional.

It will be related to some strong emotions like joy, excitement or angryness. And the blue is more cool. It will cause some calming effect on viewers. Texture is another important visual component.

With rough textures, the creator may be referring to stronger emotions, more wilder or chaotic, while smooth textures indicate less emotional scenes.

I just enjoy it.\nI have more energy after I exercise and I know it's good for my health so it makes me feel good about myself.\nAnd that's what kept me going there in the past five years.\n考生回答：The professor talks about two kinds of motivation. The first one is extrinsic, which is we tend to get praise and money through certain action. For example, a small child who takes care of household chores, simply because he does not enjoy such actions, but he will give a certain amount of money by his parents. However, if his parents stop providing the money, the kid will probably not continue his actions. For example, the professor goes to gym because she feels healthy and also very energetic after exercise. He's not a plan to become a marathon athlete. He's simply doing these actions out of his own joy. It's good for her health and also that's the reason why he goes to the gym for five years.", "output": "3.8分", "meta": {"problem_id": "005", "audio_file": "1_01.mp3"}}

When people get propelled extrinsically, they tend to do something in order to obtain external rewards. For example, a child does housework at home, not because he enjoys doing it, but because he knows if he does that, his parents will give him money. But if his parents stop doing that, he might not continue either. On the other hand, people can also do something out of internal motivation, which is long lasting, which is more long lasting. When people do this, they tend to see the pleasure and accomplishment in it. For instance, the professor has been going to gym since the past five years. She does that not because she needs to attend a marathon match or something, but she simply knows doing gym is good for her and she likes it.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "005", "audio_file": "1_02.wav"}}

She described two times the motivation. First is the extrinsic type. It is the type that people were motivated by the external factors such as rewards or pay. She provides an example of trial to illustrate this. If the trial was paid to do small housework such as taking out the garbage and earn pocket money of that, she would continue to do it. But if the parents stopped giving her money, she probably wouldn't. The second is the intrinsic type of motivation, which she defines as doing something and getting pleasure from it, which will be more long-lasting. She provides an example of her going to legend.

The extrinsing motivation that people do activities for outside reward like the praise of money or intrinsic ones that people do things because it's pleasing to do so. It's more long lasting. For extrinsing motivation that people do certain kind of things for external rewards.

The first one is extrinsic, which means that by performing certain parts, people get money and price. And the second is intrinsic, which means that people can gain pleasure and motivate it internally. And it's more than lasting. For example, external motivators means that when we get, when we perform certain things, we can obtain reward. If a small child does some job around his house, it doesn't mean that he enjoys it. But if she performs a certain task, she will receive money. But she will not be motivated enough if her parents are stopped offering money. And intrinsic motivations means that people get pleasure out of certain behaviors. They are motivated internally and have plans of a fulfilling. For example, the professor goes to gym regularly.

For example, a child does more jobs around her house, her chest, washing dishes, and pick-up of garages, because her parents will keep her small amount of money.

Another type of motivation is influencing motivation in which we engage ourselves in our activity and it pleases us internally. We do it because we enjoy doing it rather than for any accomplishment.

An example of extrinsic motivation is a child doing small jobs around house because he or she wants to get a small amount of money by doing those small jobs.

The first kind of motivation is extrinsic motivation and the second kind is intrinsic motivation.

The professor gives the example of a charge and the child does household works to get praises or money. So this is extrinsic motivation. On the other hand, intrinsic motivation is that motivation when you do something which pleases you internally and that's the reason for it to do something.

Students make intentionally efforts to help them to force them to stay focused, but it's not going to persist along. For example, if you want to introduce frogs to your students, simply by lecturing, students will be bored sooner or later, even though they provide their back to stay focused to make the intentionally efforts. And the second type of attention is called passive attention, which is involuntary. Students do not have to force themselves to pay attention actively, since the lecture is quite interesting to allow their interest. For example, by introducing frogs, if you come to a life of frog out of your brave face, and it is quite a while holding it up, students will be really abused by this lecturing.

And the second type of attention is the passive, which is involuntary. Like it does not require students to pay efforts, which is easier to take longer.

Firstly, the professor knows that the actual attention means totally volunteer and it takes effort to maintain for long time. For example, if you are a teacher in biology class and you are introducing a frog, the student wants to keep focus for long time because you are just telling them some basic information. However, the passive attention means in volunteering and it doesn't need an effort to keep focus because it's natural. If something is very interesting, the students do not have to force them to be focused. For example, back to the biology class, if you have to take a live frog from your briefcase, the students will be surprised by an accepted action and they will be engaged in your class and they do not need to force them to keep attention, which they will maintain for longer time.

First, the professor talks about active attention, which is like a voluntary type of attention. This law is much less time than the passive attention. For instance, in a biology class, the teacher starts talking about a frog like a frog is an amphibian. Whereas the passive attention requires no effort, and it happens just involuntarily, and it lasts longer, much longer than active attention.

She mentions that there are two types of attention given by the student to the class and they are active attention and active attention. And she gives specific examples for both of these types of attention in order to illustrate it. First of all, she mentions that active attention is a voluntary attention that is given by the student to the class. And it is hard to keep up with this kind of attention because it is voluntary and it is given forcibly. It is given positively, not naturally. She mentions an example of a frog lecture given to the students which speaks in a monotonous language and kids will be distracted as fast as they could from this monotony of the class. Secondly, she mentions that passive attention is involuntary and it happens naturally.

The second is called passive attention, which means it requires no effort at all.

Example would be a biology class where you are teaching about frogs and once you start blah blah blah, the interest of the student will not guaranteed to be sustained so they have to force themselves to listen to your talk but it's just a matter of time. But for passive attention, it's quite different, it's natural and it requires no effort at all. So the student wouldn't have to force themselves to focus and they do this even without thinking.

One is the active, the other is the passive. The active attention means that students who are voluntary force themselves to listen to or focus some things. It will take efforts and it will last long. For example, in a biology class, if you talk about a frog in front of the student and the your lecture is boring and tedious, well, it's not very interesting. The student will force themselves to pay attention to your lecture, but there will be a time, a matter of time that they will be get distracted. A passive attention means that it's voluntary kind of attention. There is no effort needed and it happened naturally. If something is interesting, they won't force the student to pay attention and even without stating they can focus on the material. For example, if you talk about the frog and you take a live frog from your case and describe it and then hold it in your hand to show how long the leg is to use the jump. You can even let the frog jump on the desk or the floor by doing the unexpected way you are getting students engaged and you can tap that attention.

And this drag is drew by other very interesting and abnormal phenomena. That doesn't cause a lot of energy. So in the lecture, professors use examples of using frogs in the biology class. If you just talk about the concept and the research from the book, people have to force themselves, which means they will get tired pretty quickly.

This is called active attention, because the students force themselves to do. Maybe they are not unwilling to do it. And this mainly just lasts for several minutes, it's not long time. The second term of attention is the passive attention. In the passive attention, students will concentrate on the same whether or not they are active, whereas they are not, they have the specific intention of it. Like the fraud in the biologic as a professor, but as a frog species, that was very interesting to students.

Active attention is voluntary attention, which means that you need to pay attention passionately, but it's not long-lasting. For example, in biology class, if you try to introduce a frog to students and during the lecture, the students, even though they pay active attention, they might be distracted at last because active attention is not long-lasting. However, passive attention is involuntary attention, which means you don't have to make efforts just to help naturally as long as the subject is interesting enough, you don't have to force yourself. For example, when you try to introduce the frogs, if you can bring a life of frog out of your brave cave and introduce the frog feature to students, the students will be very interested because you are doing something very engaging and expectedly, so that you can tap into passive attention and the attention can last very long.

To give an example where the teacher in the biology class teaches students what a frog is, by simply saying, a frog is an animal with four legs. And this is dull and boring. That's why students need to force themselves to focus.

Active attention are voluntary. They need efforts and need the students or the people intentionally focus on the topic or something. For example, when you are teaching your students and you are talking about frogs, you just simply describe the concept and it is boring so your students need to force them to concentrate on your topic. It is involuntary and needs no efforts. So if something is really interesting, the audience will be unconsciously attracted by this.

Take a car as an example, if a car needs too much repairs and can stay too long, we can say it's unreliable. So reliability refers to the absence of problems and defects. People used to think that reliability is of great importance, but actually things have changed nowadays. Features can even be a deciding factor when people choose in the product. It means that a product can be easier to use and cool, just like a car with electric windows, sound roofs, air conditioning, etc. You know, just because the reliability can even be equal across the world due to the manufacturing advancement.

And also with the absence of defect of problems. And sometimes people just only consider about this, but now an effector is different. So we also need to consider about the features which is the extra things of a certain products which make the products more easier to use and make it more cool and loaded with more advanced features like electric, windows and air conditioning etc. So cars is a fantastic samples for the utilization of the features.

One is reliability and the other is feature. Talking about reliability, it means that we respect the product and work as we expected. It can reasonably be working for a long time without repayment. For example, if a car doesn't work and the needed repair assume, we do not believe that it's reliable. It's actually the opposite words of defects and problems. So when we talk about quality, one million talk about reliability. But nowadays, the things can be different because the manufacturing standards are very high and cars can be reliable. So it is not as important as before. It is not a deciding fact. Well, another fact is the features because they are not something necessary, but it will make the product easier to use and cool. For example, now the car manufacturing companies, they have new features, including the electronic windows, air conditionings, and the stereo in the new cars, which will make it attractive and easier to use.

One is reliability, which means the product runs and operates in an expected way. And second is the features. So, initially, the reality people focus on reliability because the manufacturing standards varies and it's hard to manufacture a very reliable product. So, initially, people are looking forward to have a higher reliability, which they can use for a longer time and no need to repair. Same goes by the manufacturer technology or the ones, and so the reliability of different products from different companies may expect it to be the same.

Reliability means the product is so reliable as long as it can walk away as people expect it should without needing repairs to a student. If a car doesn't meet a business standard, the consumers will believe that it is not reliable. Basically, reliability means the absence of defects that people aren't expecting. In the past, people equaled a high quality with reliability. But today's living a manufacturing standard is so high. So reliability is no longer the deciding factor. And here, the step in the factor kicks in. Features. Features means the extra functions, not necessarily, but will make the products easier to use. For example, today's car are equipped with electric windows, the stereo, and the sound rules. Purchasing will make a comparison between these offers features before they make the purchase.

That is how they can decide which one has a high quality. Then the professor explains the two characters contribute to this decision, that is liability and features. The first one is liability, which is people expect to use a product for a long time without having to worry about to repair it. For example, a car is reliable if it is not breakdown or you don't have to worry about the car maintenance. Today, people still care about liability, not bad as much as before, because the manufacturer technologies are so advanced today, all the products are equally qualified. Then another factor becomes deciding that is feature, which is the product that has something, some character that is not necessary, but make the product easy to use or make it look cool.

In the past, reliability is a top important factor because people want to equal reliability to the time of its enduring or its work as expected without repairment. Take cars, for example, if cars reliable, it means it works as expected and without problems, without repairment. However, the fact that the techniques of manufacturing is getting better, most of the cars and other products are reliable. It means it works without problems.

However, so let's come to the next factor, features, which is a deciding one. In fact, features means since not that necessary, but will make them much more easier to use or just look cool.

To begin it, reliability was the first vector that people photographed value on. The reliability is people's expectation for good. For example, if car doesn't work as we expected and needed to be repaired soon, then people think that it's unreliable. However, since manufacturing standard is very high these days, it's not going to be the decision factors anymore. As a result, the second factor that people photographed value on these days is feature, which is how easily it can be used and how it looks. For example, many cars lose many features on their cars such as 10 windows or other options. Since reliability is pretty equal, so people now put a great value on features on their products to make a purchase.

So all those the consumers know that the price may get lower when it's common later. But if you are willing to pay a higher price for you to get it sooner and it works fine with those innovative and high technology products such as videos and their phones. The next another approach is to set the initial price lower for those products which whose markets are already saturated and undercut to the competitors. So that's for example, so computer makers may want to offer in a surprising low prices in order to attract those who doesn't really want to purchase computer to purchase computer and make a profit by offering those accessories like printers or software.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "008", "audio_file": "1_07.mp3"}}

The first one is starting the price high and lower down later stage. And the second one is to setting the initial price low to compete with the existing market player. So for the first strategy because high price usually means high quality and consumers usually pay for such high quality with high price. So the lecture used examples, the video recording and camera and cell phone as examples to illustrate that when this product first introduced, people were pretty high priced for these products. As for the second approach, that is the company setting the initial price low, that because they want to compete with the existing market players and gain more market share. So this a firm price could attract new customers and existing customers who are tempted to switch the brand. The company can make money by encouraging consumers to buy their products with, for example, the printer.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "008", "audio_file": "1_08.wav"}}

This kind of strategy fits for innovative high-tech products such as video recorders, cameras or cell phones. The second type of pricing strategy is to set low price at first. This is for the market that has already saturated when there are too many competition.

The first one is to set the price value high for the buy a much lower price afterwards. This is meant to build a high quality match of the product and the company can make a lot of profits from customers who are willing to pay more for a high quality product or to use it earlier. This strategy works particularly well with innovative high-tech products such as video cameras, video colors, or cell phones. The second one is to set the initial price very low. This often happens when the market is already saturated with the product and is used to undercut the competitors. A newly-stralled computer maker often sets its computer price very low, much lower than any existing brand to attract both all the new customers.

For example, when the video camera cell from first comes to the market, it's really expensive, but they will get to accessible press in the future. It's the company will send a really low-press at first because the market is a separate space. And these companies want to undercut their competitors and gain market share.

This approaches to build a high-quality image to the public. For example, companies that have innovative production such as camera or recorders always set initial price high to build a high-quality image and make high profits in the early stage of the product's lifecycle. Because people believe high price equals high quality and they want to own high-tech products sooner. The second pressing strategy is to set low initial price. In this way, companies can anti-card competitors in a saturated market. For example, the starting computer company will sell their products cheaper than existing brands so that they can obtain customers who weren't interested in buying a computer and who will switch brands because of low price.

We all know that insects like to eat plants, but some plants have been able to develop ways to protect themselves from insects. Today I'm going to talk about some ways plants defend themselves. Now, some plants have physical features that prevent insects from landing on them, like the passion plant for example. Its leaves have little spiky hairs all over them. They're like spikes sticking out of the plant that are so numerous and dense that they prevent insects from landing on the leaves. Basically, there's just no room for the insect to land. And since insects can't land on leaves, they can't eat them. So the little hairs serve as a physical feature that helps protect the passion plant from insects. Alright. But other plants protect themselves using chemical defenses. Like the potato plant. The potato plant's able to release a chemical throughout its leaf system whenever an insect attacks it, starts eating leaf. So, say an insect starts eating a potato plant's leaf. That will cause the plant to react by releasing a chemical throughout its leaf system. The insect swallows this chemical as it eats.

We generally assume that babies cries when other babies cry, when other babies cry, is because of the noise. But when they experiment, they're putting a tape of one baby crying, it results in another baby crying. But when the experimenter played a tape of the baby's own crying, it does not result in the baby's crying.

Unity is using similar elements such as color in a room, so it can be using varying shades of the same color on different materials, such as the rug and the wall paint. And unity can bring order and comfort for its inhabitants. However, too much unity can be boring, so you need to define this by bringing in contrast, which is suddenly changing color or material. And this can make things pop out from their norm. And for example, if you're painting the walls, dark green, you need to bring in a red sofa so that it contrasts and bring a balance on unity and contrast.

Once the United and other is contrast, United means bringing together same elements into a design. For example, you can use green to decorate your house, grassy green for the wall, darker, sheady green for the sofa, and complement with matching green in the rock. And this will provide you a sense of order and consistency. However, if you have too much United in a room, it will be boring. Still need some contrast to bring up the new United to make your room leaver. For example, you can put red cushions on the green sofa so that the green appears greener next to the red.

For example, for unity, it also means constancy. You bring similar elements together. For example, by colors. We take green for example. You can pick the same colors to different parts of your room. For example, you can use the light green for the words and dark greens to the fabric on sofa. And then you can mix those greens together on other parts of the room so they can match unitly and create an order as well as comfort. But you have too much unity. It will make the room a boring one. A second row is the contrast. It means disrupt or break up the unity in a careful and intentional way. For example, the colors. You need to change the colors once for a while. For example, you can bring some very strong red colors into the green room so that the green color will look greener. But you cannot make too much red because if you make this row too seriously, there will be something very much in the room and it can be quite dangerous.

People need to make a balance between unity and contrast. The first principle is unity, which means consistency. People tend to make it by bringing similar elements together, for example, matching color. We could pick a color and use the color in different parts of the room. By complement the color, we put the similar elements together and create a sense of order and comfort and create a unified room. But we need to keep in mind that too much unity may make the room boring. And the second principle is here is contrast. That is to disrupt the unity in a careful way. For example, by using color, we might do the color theme abruptly. For instance, we might put a right cushion on a green sofa. By doing this, we could make things that stand out. For example, we make the room more interesting, not totally the same. But we should also keep in mind that too much contrast will make the room too busy and chaotic.

The first principle is unity, which is consistency. By bringing in similar elements together, say matching colors. For example, if we put some light shade green on a wall, we might as well want to put some dark green shade on a sofa. So the color will be unified and people will feel comfort and order. However, we might as well need to be careful for too much unity since you will make the result boring. The second principle is contrast, which serves to disrupt breakup unity in careful way. For example, we might abruptly change color schemes once in a while. For example, we put some bright recusion in green sofa. Surprisingly, the green will stand out and become greener. And now the room will become interesting. However, we still have to be careful.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "011", "audio_file": "1_07.wav"}}

First, unity. Unity is a kind of way that brings similar things together. An example that Vasset took was the color. Like when somebody is painting a room, they can use the green for multiple different objects. For example, they can use the light green for the walls and use the dark green for the sofa. So when the colors match, it gives people feel more comfortable and lead to the consistent. However, if you use too much of it, it's also not that balanced because the painting is getting boring. So the second principle is the construct, which disrupts the unity in an intentional way. The example is also the color. Like we sometimes need some color that abruptly changes. For example, you need a bright red inclusion on the green sofa. And it will make the green more ring with leads to a different, however, using too much of the construct is also not beneficial.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "011", "audio_file": "1_08.mp3"}}

It's really achieved by bringing together similar components. One example is matching color. For example, we use green for different parts of the room. For example, like a green sofa, a green wall or something, and use something to complement the green, like a different shade of green on the mugs. But this actually brings order and comfort to the dweller of the room. But if unity is too much, it actually makes the room boring. And contrast means disrupting unity in a careful and intentional way. For example, we put black cushions on the green sofa, so the green would stand out, and the room is more interesting.

They are the unity and contrast. The unity, which means constancy, is to put similar elements together. He took the color as an example. If you are painting your wall, you can paint it into the light color and buy a darker grain silver and buy a curtain in grain so that the colors can match each other and make her home look in peace. However, too much unity can also bring the sense of boring. So in order to make the counterbalance, you need to break it. So here comes the contrast, which means disrupt. He also takes the color as an example. In order to break that unity, you can buy a red sofa so that it can stand out from the grain colors.

Both of these should have a really good balance. For example, when it comes to unity, you can use similar colors and materials to make your home inconsistent with each other. For example, if you choose green as your main color and you may find some light green or dark green in your room. However, if you use too much elements that are the same, which means you have unity, but it might be too boring. So you also need the contrast. Contrast that means, for example, when it comes to the color, you can use some a little bit of red instead of the green. This kind of contract will, if you made your green, looks better and make your room more interesting.

First there are those products called substitute goods. If products can be substituted for one another, then they're called substitute goods. They're similar enough to be interchangeable. And an increase in the price of one means an increase in the demand for the other, like butter and margarine. They're pretty much used for the same price. So you see, an increase in the price of butter increases the demand for margarine. Now another instance where the price of one product can influence the demand of another is when you have two products that can't be used without each other. Those products we call complement goods. They complement or complete each other, if you will. Like compact discs and compact disc players. You need both products in order to use either.

The first is to develop permanent colour or shape to resemble to a particular part of the environment. For example, the leafy sea dragon looks like a small green dragon with leaf proportions sticking out like arms. When it swims through these kinds of environments, we'll have difficulty seeing it. However, without these green plants, it will be identified easily. The second is by changing colours. For example, the cloud of fish can blend in with nearly anywhere, because it has shifting pigment in which it enables it to change colours in a matter of seconds to match the surroundings. For example, it swims through green sea plant, it will turn green, which swims through brown sea floor, it will turn brown.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "013", "audio_file": "1_01.mp3"}}

Some birds have eyes that face forward on the skull, kind of similar to how humans eyes are positioned. Forward facing eyes allow a bird to clearly see and judge distances because it can focus on objects with both of its eyes and correctly perceive height, width and depth. One type of bird with eyes positioned in the front of the skull is the hawk. Hawks eat animals like mice. Hawks have such good eyesight that they can spot a tiny mouse in a field from high up in the air. They spot the mouse and swoop down to catch it. Without such good eyesight, they would not be able to spot or catch their food. Other birds have eyes that are located on each side of the skull. This positioning of the eyes can help a bird to avoid predators. Instead of just seeing what's directly in front, they can see things that are on either side, permitting them to watch for danger in all directions. Imagine a duck wading near the edge of a lake. It needs to spend time eating grasses and insects. But it also is on constant lookout for danger from its predator, like the fox.

So for two groups of people, one is internal and then the one is external. For the internal group of people, they would like to have the significant amount of time to prepare for the product because they think that without is their own possibility. So if they get accepted, they will think that they're working hard. If they get rejected, they would think that they need to improve for the second time. For the external guys, they always blame all the interviewers. So if they get accepted, they would think that they're lucky and all the interviewers are having a very good day. If they are rejected, they would like to blame all the interviewer.

And the internal locus of control refers to the control comes from inside of the person, and external locus of control comes from someone else. And she used the example of going to hunting for a job as an example. If she has internal locus of control, then she will believe her success due to her while working. Then she will work very hard ahead of time. If she didn't get the job, she will disappoint and blame herself and try to improve the next time. If the candidate is the external locus of control, then he will believe in luck. And if he get employed, it may be just because of good luck. If done, then he will blame the interviewers having a really bad day, or he will blame the bad luck instead of blaming himself.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "016", "audio_file": "1_06.mp3"}}

And if it is a success, then she might take the responsibility on himself. And think that it was because of her great preparation and working hard on it.

For example, an internal woman who's going for an interview is going to prepare herself in the once. And if she wins, she tends to think that the success comes from her hard work. And if she fails, she tend to blame herself and try to figure out how to behave by her next time. On the other hand, the external woman is going to take race. And if she's going to rely more on the external factors, for example, merely the luck. And if she's just winning the position, she's going to think that it is the luck where the interviewer having a good day that calls him to get the job.

An internal person tends to believe that their lives are controlled by themselves, but an external person believes just the opposite approach. For example, in an internal person tends to believe his success is his own responsibility. His success can be attributed to his hard-working, and if he don't get the job, he will find a way to improve himself. On the contrary, the external person tends to rely on other things, such as the interview's mood. Rather than being hard on themselves, they would like to take risks and apply for the job that they are not completely qualified for. So if they get the job, they will feel they are lucky if they don't get the job.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "016", "audio_file": "1_16.wav"}}

For the internal parts, people tend to think that the results are from within themselves. For example, a woman was going to find a job and take an interview. And she will think that if she succeeds, then it is because she works very hard and prepares very well. If she doesn't, then she feels very disappointed and figure out what to improve next time. Second, for the external part, people will tend to think that it is the interviewer's responsibility and they like to take risks.

Internal one and external one. In terms of the first one, internal looks of control. It means that people always attribute the outcome of a certain event to their internal factors, like their own efforts or diligence. For example, there was a woman in a job interview and she prepared her very thoroughly and she got the interview. So she would let it attribute the success of the interview to her own effort. However, if she failed, she still would let it blame herself for not being that. Industrial is enough. However, if the woman belongs to the category of the external look of control, she would like to attribute the outcome of the event to the external factors. On the same interview, when she failed it, she would like to blame that it wasn't her lucky day or probably the interviewer was not in very good mood.

For example, the modern newspaper. The letters on the newspaper were borrowed from another culture centuries ago. And the printing technology was invented in Germany. The paper was invented in China. So through this combination of innovations, people shared the culture through time. Then this means that diffusion can happen over a long distance and over a long period of time. So diffusion can also be selected. For example, people in the US mostly will accept the practice of acupuncture. But they would not accept the philosophy of the acupuncture.

For example, a newspaper is actually the combination of two other inventions, which are printing technique and paper. And printing techniques were developed in German, and the paper was invented by Chinese. So we now know that the diffusion can occur globally, and diffusion can happen through a long time period and can also be transferred through long distance. However, the diffusion is also selective. For example, many American people believe a kind of Chinese medical technique. However, only a few of them really understand the philosophy behind the technique.

For example, in U.S., the acupuncture is quite popular, because the citizens there believe that it can kill the disease effectively. But very few people could understand a lot of it behind it.

That is a cultural invention, diffused from one place to another, or from one society to another. Then the professor talks about two ways it could happen. The first one is newspaper. When people read the newspaper today in the US, it might not know that the printing technique was brought from German, and the paper was invented in China. These techniques were shared all around the world, so people today in the US could read the newspapers. That means diffusion could happen in long distance and in long period. Then the professor says that the diffusion could happen selectively. Then she used the example of acupuncture to illustrate ideas. Acupuncture is a Chinese medicine way to use needles to cure people. Although very few people in US understand the philosophy behind it, the acupuncture still are diffused into the culture of US, and people use that technique to cure the diseases.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "017", "audio_file": "1_07.mp3"}}

They have been actually borrowed from other cultures. It was invented in Germany. The newspaper itself was taken from China.

And sometimes, this kind of process could be achieved through a variety of ways. For instance, the modern newspaper that the American people are now reading is actually borrowed from a lot of different countries. For example, the painting itself letters and the words and the papers invented from different countries like China. But diffusion could be difficult and selective. Sometimes it could take a Chinese acupuncture, for instance. The American people now accept it as an effective way of treatment. But they just don't accept the whole philosophy besides this treatment.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "017", "audio_file": "1_15.mp3"}}

Kids, right?\nSo, if the company wants to make sure its television advertising reaches its target customers,\nit'd want to advertise during times when kids are actually watching television...\nlike during children's television shows.\nThat way it can make sure that kids see the advertisements.\nAnd that way the company'd get people in that age group...to go buy toy cars...\nor to ask their parents to buy 'em at least.\nNow, another important characteristic to consider is geographic location...\nplaces where the company's target customers live.\nThink about a company that makes boats.\nIts target customers are people who own homes near oceans or lakes...\nplaces where they can use boats.\nAfter all, people who don't live near water don't have much use for boats.\nSo, by placing advertisements on signs along the road or on television in cities and towns that are near oceans or lakes,\nthe company'd be more likely to reach the target customers for its boats...\nand sell more of 'em as a result.\n考生回答：In this lecture, the professor is talking about two characteristics of target customers, which means people who are likely to buy a company's product. The first example is age. For example, for a toy car company, their target customer is Kate. So they may put their advertisement on children's TV show. In this way, children may be able to see them and they may want to buy them or at least call their parents to buy them. The second characteristic is geographic location. For both companies, their target customers are people who are living near the ocean or lake. So they may put their advertisement on signs, around roads or televisions in cities or towns near the ocean or lakes. In this way, they are more likely to reach their target customers and sell more of them. As you can see, these are the two examples mentioned in the lecture that demonstrate what is target customer in this business class.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "018", "audio_file": "1_01.mp3"}}

See birds developed to help them find food. The first is the lens of wind. For example, albatross has long winds which in February 2 glide or float and the wind so that it will consume a little energy. Unlike other birds who have to, you know, flap their winds up and down, which consumes a lot of energy, so that the albatross can, you know, can actually cover large expense, can large expensive ocean. Sometimes even 1100 miles a day. The second is the actual scenes of smelling. Well, as seen in the plumber, you know, the plumber has tiny tubes and it's not cells who knows trials which help it pick up the scene of its prey. Well, it's the main source of animal. The main source of food is a little plankton which is too tiny to see.

She could use her imagination by inventing a very happy story. She could imagine that possibly a nice family, which will be able to feed the dog has found the dog, and the dog is not really happy. She could picture that the dog is playing, so she is no longer sad about the dog running away. It's not real, but it keeps her pain in the way.

And the professor gives two examples here. The first one is the fantasy mechanism. Well, in this case, people use imagination to prevent themselves from the pain. For example, I would not maybe lost a dog and cannot find it. So this is the fantasy mechanism. You would imagine a happy story for this, like a new family-bound historical log, and you would imagine that they're quite happy and having fun. So this is the imagination.

For example, the woman having a dog and the dog has kept the company for a very long time, a dog ran away and she looked for a very long time, but she couldn't find the dog. The first mechanism is that she used the fantasy that is imagination. So instead of only filming half-list, the woman were invent happy stories. For example, she figured out that maybe a new nice family feed the dog and the dog is living happy life. The dog played everywhere, having fun and they're running up and down. So she won't feel satisfied. Furthermore, the fantasy is not real, but it can help the woman to keep the pain away. The second mechanism is sublimation. It's not about pretending. It can turn the negative sounds into useful and practical behaviors. For example, the woman can attend a dog training school and it can help the train dogs in order to help the people to prevent those dogs from running away. So it will actually turn the negative sounds into those positive and the constructive behaviors. Thank you very much.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "020", "audio_file": "1_10.wav"}}

And the professor gave an example of a woman lost her dog and a cousin found even more. And she mentioned two defense maximum here. The first one is the fantasy maximum. In this case, the woman would imagine a new happy story for his dog. For example, a new family once her dog and they're playing happy and having fun. And this is totally imagination actually. And the second mechanism is the sublimation. In this case, the woman no longer pretend to be happy rather than if that she would change her negative feeling into some useful emotions. For example, she would start a dog training school. She would prevent the two trained dogs to prevent them and pretend themselves from running away. So this is actually a reduction to some positive and constructive activity.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "020", "audio_file": "1_11.mp3"}}

The first one is fantasy, which means the woman will create an imagination to remove her sadness. For instance, she may invent a happy story in her mind about the dog, in which the dog may be found by a nice family and fell down carefully, thus living a happy life. But creating a fantasy, the woman won't be sad about her dog's running away anymore. The second one is a diplomat. Which means the woman will turn her negative emotions through something useful. For instance, she may just establish a dog training school, in which she can provide trainees for dogs from other families, thus preventing them to run away just like her doctors. In this way, she just can redirect her feelings into a positive and practical activity.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "020", "audio_file": "1_12.mp3"}}

Also, there are two types of defense mechanisms. The first one is fantasy. The second one is sublimations. Takes a pet dog, as an example. Well, the woman has a pet dog and she once the dog runs away and she feels very helpless. And she wants to overcome this problem. She will find, try to picture this dog was picked by others, somebody else and somebody else take care of her dog very nicely. And this kind of pictures will come into her mind and it's just fantasy, but it's not real. The second one is sublimation. Sublimation is more realistic. It will turn some negative salt into a positive and useful way. Such as the woman will try to build a school to train a lot of dogs not running away from her.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "020", "audio_file": "1_13.wav"}}

The first aspect was the descent of the protection. She gave an example by the clothes. Initially, the clothes were made in some homemade works shops. However, with the invention, the steam power machine clothes were started to be made in some factories where the clothes could be produced more efficiently. There was no dust, there was no point of still producing it at home. The second thing was the formation of those cities.

The first change is that the center of production moved from home to factory. People used to make clothes out at their homes with only little money and sustain themselves. But after the invention of steam machine, this machine could weave clothes much faster than individual in the home. So it makes no sense for people to remain at their home to weave these clothes. Another change is that cities start to form a round factory. This is because considered a factory that we close in a small village. The factory will hire rural workers who live in countryside.

For European countries, especially England, new factories started to show up and brought to major changes. The first change is that the center of production moved from home to factories. Clothes, for example, are made by hands at home for centuries. However, after Industrial Revolution, clothes are made at factories due to the effective machines, like steam-powered machines. The second one is that cities formed around factories. Huge factories need a great number of people to work for them so that a new city will show up to fit the needs of the workers.

People had made cars by hand, and they're him earning a little money from their home-based car production.

So, in 18th century, industrial revolution was taken place, especially in England. And there are two main changes that occurred. First, at the center of production, shift from home to factory, then take clothes as an example. Well, in the past, those clothes are basically made at home. However, with invention of machine, the wave can be much more quickly than the human mate. So, that's why the class moved from home to factory. And the other change is that cities started forming around factories. Last thing, a factory was found in a small village and it needed a lot of people. And a lot of people coming to this small town to be hired by this job, and the village became bigger and bigger and foreign city.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "021", "audio_file": "1_10.mp3"}}

The first one is the change of locations of production. She mentions that historically, people in Britain wave for clouds by hand at home for a little bit money. But after the steam power engine was invented, the big factories which can wave clouds more efficiently and faster was built. Secondly, cities start to form around the factories. For instance, if a cloud factory was built in a small village, it would have a lot of workers. When the remote workers move into the village and start to live there, the small village will grow bigger and larger into big cities.

And the professor explained that there are two changes that took place during the industrialization process. The first thing that took place was the fact that people started to manage manufacture clothes at factories using the machines rather than by hand at their home. The reason for that is because of the efficiency of using the machines. The second major change was that instead of having people spread around the country, people started together around those factories.

The first one is the central production shift from family to the factory. For example, when producing clocks, in the old times people made clocks at home and it is very slow. However, during the Industrial Revolution, people started to use the machines which can work very fast and do very precise work and also on the factories and the other shift is that more and more cities forming around the factories because factories need workers, so they hired many rural workers once lived in the rural sites. However, after a known while, the workers congregate in the village and thus the village becomes bigger and bigger. Eventually it becomes a city.

The first one is the center of production has shift and the other one is the city has rise. For the first change, the professor mentions that the center of production has shifted from home to factories. For example, clothes which was originally produced at hand and by hand and at homes were now used in factories to manufacture and bring those clothes with machines. As a result, it is no longer produced solely at homes. It is produced in facture and in facture racing set and furthermore, the cities, the rise of cities are more and more villages become cities due to the cause of its increasing populations. For example, factories and villages need to hire a lot of workers from nearby villages. So the populations in villages become bigger and bigger.

First is that the production center is shifting from home to the factories. One of the examples is the clock making businesses in the past where there are no steam machines. The clock is usually manufactured at home. However, with the help of new technologies such as steam machines, now clocks can be massively produced in the machines, which shifted the center of production from home to the factory. And the second change is that big cities are gradually growing around the factories. The example is also clock. When the clocks are made in small village, it is badly in need of workers who transit from countryside to congregate around the villages. And as more and more workers are emigrating to the village of making clocks, the whole village is growing bigger. This is finally coming into a big city as a whole.

So they have significant changes which has occurred during after the machines began to be used. These changes are first center of production or shifted from homes to factories. As an example, when the clothes were made by hand, the people used to earn money from home base clothing. But when the steam in steam power machines came, they produced clothes very quickly and efficiently. So they switched over to the steam power machines. Another change which has occurred is that city began to form. When the clothes factory was established in the small village, they need workers to work in the factory. So most of the workers and the laborers came from the countryside to the village in order to establish the factory and work in the factory. So that village began to grow into a city.

And actually, in the past, people used to make clouds in home, and such homemade clouds have been continued for centuries. However, since the steam machine is easier and faster, most of the production has moved to the factory instead of home. And the second change is that the city started to forming around the factories.

For example, in early times before the industrial revolution, many homes will try to produce fabric by hand by themselves to make some money. But after weaving machines powered by steam engines were invented, these factories were much more efficient. So it no longer made sense to produce those cloths by hand and cloths were more and more manufactured in the factory. Another change is that cities began forming around factories. So workers will be needed for the factories and when they move into the villages with the factories, the village will grow larger and larger and it will eventually become a city.

For example, people always, you know, made their own clocks by handing their houses. However, since machines can make clocks much more efficiently and much faster, after the appearance of machines, people just gradually stopped making clocks themselves and factories. They began to produce them. The second change is cities started to form around some factories. There was a big factory which was located in the village.

Before the invention of a machine, people made their product like fabric clothes by hand at home, which was low and not very efficient. However, when the machine was introduced, it was faster and it could wave clothes more quickly and efficiently. So factories soon replaced the home-based production business and became the center of production. Another result is that cities began to form around factories. When a factory was built in a village, it would need workers to operate the clothes machine. So the farmers who used to live in the countryside would have to move to the village and they started to calculate there. As a result, the village grew bigger and bigger and finally turned into a city. So this is a two-man change that caused by the invention of machine clothes.

Well, simply how to move underground through the dirt. Another challenge for the animal is to protect vulnerable parts of its body from the environment that it's moving through. Now, moving through soil is not like moving through air or water, because soil, earth, is thick and dense. So animals that live underground have evolved physical features that help them move through dirt efficiently. For example, the mole, a small furry mammal, has really wide super strong front feet with big claws. The moles feet act like shovels, so it can dig through the dirt. The claws cut into the dirt, loosen it up, and then once the dirt is loosened up, the broad feet throw the dirt behind the mole as it moves forward. These shovel-like front feet allow a mole to dig its way through the dirt astonishingly quickly. But even for an animal that can move efficiently through the dirt, living under ground can still be problematic, because it's easy for particles to get caught in sensitive parts of the animal's body, like for mammals in their eyes. So underground animals have developed adaptations to prevent this. Again, let's take the example of the mole. To begin with, moles have tiny eyes, and these eyes are covered with a thin skin, a protective membrane that's actually got hair on it. These hairs protect the mole 's eyes from dirt particles. So as the mole goes digging through the dirt with its head pushed forward, the dirt particles come into contact with the hairy membrane covering the mole's tiny eyes, and the particles just slide by, don't get caught in the mole's eyes. So the eyes, the mole's sensitive parts, are protected.", "output": "0.0分", "meta": {"problem_id": "022", "audio_file": "1_02.mp3"}}

Once the insects are attracted by the sweet nectar and they learn their leaves, the flight tribe will shut the leaves to form a little cage and the insects will be trapped inside and cannot fly away so that venous flight tribe can digest the insects as well. The second mechanism is called passive trapping mechanisms because plants don't have moving parts to catch the insects, such as the sundial plant, which could also produce sweet nectar on their leaves.

The first is active provides an example of the banal supply trap plants to the tree systems that this plant have to move to catch their prey and their leaves are hinged leaves and you normally opens into two half and closes to catch insects. And on the leaf, it's the leaf also secretes next to her that the sweet and attractive to insects. So when insects land on the leaf of the banal supply trap, the leaf was bred open and then it was shot as a result. It forms a cave that traps insects and digests it. And then this plant is able to get its nutrients. And second is the passive trap she provides an example of the sound you plant to your tree systems. The sound you plant also secretes next to her that is attractive and switch to the insect. And the leaves also have little hairs that secretes to kill substances.

The first one is an active trap, and the second one is a passive trap. In terms of the active trap, Professor give us an example of the Venus fly trap, which has two leaves usually open. There are a lot of hairs on the surface of the leaves, so when it says the landing insect can quickly close and from the shape of the cage, so the insect cannot escape and gradually got digested. So the Venus fly trap can sustain the life by digesting and absorbing the nutrients from the animals caged. However, the second type of the trap is an inactive or passive trap. For example, the sundew plant. It could secrete a super sticky glue-like substance to attract the animals or flights, or the insects will fly over and stands lens on them. Once it lands on them, it got totally pasted and sticked on it because of the super sticky glue-like substance.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "023", "audio_file": "1_11.wav"}}

So the first one is the active, which means like Venus they can move and capture pretty quickly. So they can generate some sweet flavors, liquid on their plant and check insects to stop by lamb. Then their leaves were just closed like a cage, to chop the insect, and they can digest that insect gradually. And the second one is the passive chain, Sun Dusects. This kind of place they will generate some sticky grooves on their hair like these, and they can stick the insect.

So the objective narrative will just tell the audiences what they say to each other or what they do. Like they sitting down about or looking out of the window. Leading questions to be filled in by the audiences. The second type is omniscient narrative. Omniscient narrative where tell audiences everything except doing and what they say, including what the characters thinking about.

Rocks are often exposed to water, so they can break as a result of water freezing inside of them. When it rains, the rain water falls into the small cracks in the rock and stays here. Then when the temperature drops at night, the water freezes into ice, which expands and stick out of the cracks, pushing outward in this. Gradually enlarging the cracks until finally the rock breaks off from the inside. Another one is by plant growth. Usually there are some dirt in the cracks or on the top of the rock, which is enough for a plant to grow there. So when the seed of a plant stays, it may take roots here and the roots then extend deeper into the cracks searching for the water and nutrients. Over time, the roots grow bigger and deeper.

When this happens again and again, the crack becomes larger, and eventually pieces of the rock break off. Okay, weathering can also be caused by plants, by plant growth. If a plant seed gets blown into the crack of a rock, it may take root, and its roots will grow down into the rock. The plant's roots can cause the rock to break down, a fracture. You may have seen this with large trees growing on top of a rock. A great example of this.

While women say it is much larger because of two main reasons. The first reason is they use more advanced technology. They use the building materials like the concrete which could be hot on the waters. So it could be used to build bridges which could cross a wide river and also the treatment could be transported from one side of the river to another side with back and so it allows them to create a larger cities. And the second reason is because of the improved way to move fresh and clean waters. It is you apply the technology called Acryndamics which is an open channel.

First way is that they had advanced building materials such as concrete, which could be stronger and faced with water. By using the concrete, ancient romance can build bridges across wide rivers to transplant huge amounts of materials. But in this way, they can easily build their pallets on both sides of the rivers, which could greatly help them to expand their cities. The second way is that they create a construction called aqueducts, which could use to move the fresh clean water over great distances for human use. So people could acquire drinking and bathing water without living near the river. This way, there were no restrictions for them to build their houses and other facilities.

Another technology is an improved way to move freshwater, a structure called aqueducts. That's judged from water sources high in the mountain down to the city and provide steady flow of freshwater along the steady job of altitude.

While Roman people had larger cities for two reasons. First of all, the higher technology makes new structures of buildings possible. For example, the Roman people use this concrete, which can harden under the water to build the larger bridges which extends to the other side of the river and with bridges and cars going on it. Thus, Roman cities expand to the other side of the river, which is the nature boundary for other ancient cities. Secondly, Roman people know how to remove fresh water. They invent this special technology, which called echodronk, to transport water from a higher mountain to the cities. The technology is so advanced that they can transport tremendous amount of water to a great distance, that people can drink and basin, even though they didn't live near the city.

An example is a concrete that helped them build bridges that are big to transfer the concrete and also they could build bridges under the water. They were creating large cities. The second is that they had improved ways to build and get large clung water because they built structures called upper structure, open channels that stretch from one water way to other part of the city.

With this concrete, they built bridges across white rivers and they transported gurus by wagons. And the important type of development was that they were able to locate cities into new areas even far away from the river. For example, they put a transport of the freshwater through aqueducts that were a source of open water channels, which could move the freshwater from the water sources high up in the mountain to cities. And they used the change of the attitude that applies that of water to people who live away from the rivers. So people live in the urban areas because they do have a fresh water to base and drink. So this way successfully expanded as they did into a remote area. The cities could not be visited.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "027", "audio_file": "1_10.wav"}}

However, the Roman manager to solve these two problems. Firstly, they developed some advanced technologies such as building materials. For example, Z has some special concrete, which could be used underwater. In this way, they could build some better and formal bridges across the white rivers. And since the bridges allowed quite heavy transportation, the freaks would never be prevented by the rivers. And secondly, they also invented a way to move fresh clean water from the watersheds. For example, Z imbued some structures like open channels to stretch the water from high mountains to the city. And since the amount of water to the places far from rivers was tremendous, paper could drink and bath all the time.

And the professor talks about two main developments. The first one is the advanced building materials, which included concrete. This kind of special concrete can be hardened on the water, therefore it can be used to build better bridges. This kind of bridges can be across the rivers and even show that the weight of wagons and cars that transported materials and things. Therefore, cities can develop on both sides of the rivers. Another development is the movement of fresh and clean water for which Roman people use a special facility called aqueducts. This is the kind of open channel which carries water from water source on high mountains to the city center. It can carry large amount of water and even to places far away. Therefore, even the cities wasn't located near water. People there can use fresh water. So, thank you very much.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "027", "audio_file": "1_14.mp3"}}

The first one is the special good material, for example, the concrete in cement. The second one is the building of the aqueduct. Well, as for the first one, most of the Roman cities are confined simply because they cannot cross the river. So people have developed a very strong material like the concrete in order to build the bridges, which are rough enough to allow the people and wagons to go across it. In this way, cities can be expanded on both sides of the river. And the next one is about the aqueduct. Usually people need to build the cities along the river because they need water resource. However, with the help of the aqueduct, cities can be built far away from the water sources because the water can be delivered by the aqueduct.

Also, they cannot across the natural barriers. However, the Roman cities are very large and they are normally larger than other Asian cities. The reason for that is they utilize very advanced technology. The first one they use is a concrete building material. They use that material to build a fairly big bridge to cross a very huge river and the bridge is very solid so they can transfer different stuffs between the river band. So they end up creating a very large city. And the second advanced technology they use is that aqueducts. The aqueducts is an open water waste which is used to move away fresh water. It uses the added use to let water flow smoothly from the mountain to the city. So the people can use water even though they live far away from the water resources.

The first technology is a new building material, which is called concrete. Concrete could be hardened on the waters, so they could use concrete to build a better bridge, which could cross the red rivers and let the horse come and forth on the bridges. So cities could develop on both sides of the rivers. The main technology they use is to move the freshwater smoothly, which is called catecoast, which is an open channel and could move waters from modern start to cities. They are carefully built to let the water go smoothly. So actually, this channel could cross land distance and the cities don't need to go just around the rivers. It could expand into the interiors land.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "027", "audio_file": "1_22.mp3"}}

The first is they can have more advanced technology that helps them to build more materials, like, for instance, the concrete, which will become very hard underwater. And with this, they can build a better bridge, which is so hard and solid, and to let the cars and cargos be transformed to the other side. And thus, the large city just grows across the outside of the river. And the second is the technology can allow them to move the fresh and clean water across the other side, for instance, like the afterdocks. And with this, the people can just add a bit of water at a very high level and then drop the water down. And in this way, they can transport more water to the outside and allow the residents to drink and bait.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "027", "audio_file": "1_23.mp3"}}

For the advanced building materials, professor uses bridges as an example. The material that was used to build bridges is called concrete, which allowed them to build new kinds of structures. This kind of bridge can cross the river and allow heavy cars to join on the ground. So the city no need to be limited by the natural barrier. For the capability of moving fresh clean water, the professor uses an aqueduct as an example. Aqueduct is an open channel, which allows the fresh water to steadily flow from mountain to the city. So the city don't need to be near the river, it can be far from the river. So the city can be built in the new location, which can expand the area.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "027", "audio_file": "1_24.wav"}}

And year after year, layers of dead plant materials will just pile on one another and there is less and less room for lake water. Eventually, the lake might be completely filled up. Another example is that when farmers seek to irrigate their crops, they might construct a huge pipe to pump lake water to their fields. This doesn't do any harm as long as the lake is perpetually refilled by stream water or rain water.

And the new plants will also die and the secos goes on. The lake will be built up and it will fill the lake up with this organic matter content. And thus, there will be no room for waters to fill in.

Then she explains her it could occur by two means, by nature elements or by human activity. First of all, she mentions that a lake could be filled with organism bodies and disappear. In a lake there are a lot of plants growing. When they die, they will become this muddy material and drop to the bottom of the lake. Then they were replaced by new plants. Over a year and a year over, laid on top of another, until the lake was filled with organism bodies and disappear due to the less and less space. The second way a lake could disappear could be traced to human activity, for example. A farmer needs to irrigate plant and sow pump water from the nearby lake to the farmland. If there is not enough rain or stream water to refill the lake, it will eventually dry up.

First is natural processes and the other one is human activities in natural processes. As an example, lakes are filled up with organisms which act as sediments. So with these plants usually die out, they get involved into a muddy substance at the depth of the lake. And when all the times die out, the materials can fill up to the top of the lake and then the lakes will disappear. And another way is through human activities. As an example, the professor discusses there is a farmer who needs water to irrigate his crops. So he pumps out the water from the lake and irrigates his crops. It is okay if the lake is being eventually filled with rain or something else but if the lake is not being filled and it is completely being consumed in the lake.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "028", "audio_file": "1_04.wav"}}

The first one is natural effector, which means that organic sediment would be grown up and there would be less and less water in the lake. You know, there were lots of plants growing up in the lake. So, when the lake were died, they would become the money sediment, subsidies. So, until the new plants and the diamond, they fall into the sediment. So, there would be more and more organic sediment in the lake bottom. So, that in this way, the lake could be completely disappeared. As for the second, the human activity.

The first one is through natural process and the second one is through human activity. For example, Lake can disappear naturally. That is to say they will be filled up with organic vitamins. For example, this happens a lot with the lake where there are a lot of trees that grow nearby. For example, when the plants die, they will turn to muddy substances and fall to the bottom of the lake. Over time, these vitamins will be built up and that is to say the lake will be filled up. For example, the lake will be filled up and disappear. The second type of disappearance is caused by human activities. For example, farmers need water to irrigate their crops. So they will pump water out of the lake nearby.

When we are looking at lakes, we assume it's permanent. However, it's not. It can disappear through waste. The first one is natural process. Let's imagine there's a lake and sometimes they get filled in with organic sediments. Because when plants die, the sediment of plants will die into the bottom of the lake and over years. These sediments can be built up and there are less and less room left for the lake. Eventually, it will disappear. And the other way is that through human activity.

After a long time, the dead plant material will build up at the bottom and fuel up the lake. So there's less room for the water.

First, legs will disappear naturally. For example, they will be filled up by organic residents. Some legs have a lot of plants growing in land. After plants died, they will break into materials and replace by new plants, and new plants will die also. The cycle will continue. So, the room of the lake will be taken by plants substances, and the whole lake will eventually get filled in. The other way is by human activities. And she takes the farmers a example.

Okay, so of course businesses want to sell as many of their products as possible. Often a business sells mostly one type of product, but sales of this product may stop increasing because most potential customers have already bought it. In this situation many companies will try to diversify to develop new or diverse products in order to increase sales. There are a couple of efficient ways that a company can diversify using some of their existing resources. One way a company can diversify is to use an existing technology, technology that they already have to develop a new product. If a company already has the machines and technology to make a certain product, sometimes it can efficiently use that same technology to make a different product. For example, a company that makes televisions might start making computer monitors. Because the technology used to make these two products is very similar. So the company can use its existing technological resources to make the monitors, but with the monitors it can reach new customers, people that wouldn't buy television screens, like businesses that need to buy monitors for their employees' computers. Another way a company can diversify is to try to appeal to its existing customers, its customer base, with a new product. One of the most important resources is its existing customers, and these customers might have other needs that the company could fulfill with a different product. For example, a company that sells skis might have a large customer base that enjoys winter sports, like skiing down snowy mountains, so they might start making ski jackets. The same customers that buy skis would also need warm ski jackets to wear while they're skiing, and since they like the company's skis, it's easy to buy the jackets with a company's name on them.", "output": "3.8分", "meta": {"problem_id": "029", "audio_file": "1_01.mp3"}}

The first is that it will enable animals to minimize their exposure to extreme temperatures, especially in the harsh climate places where it will be dangerous to stay at the surface. For example, in the Sahara desert in the South Africa, there is a kind of lizard who would move quickly and easily beneath the sand. In this way, they don't need to expose themselves in the really high and dangerous temperature. And second is that it will help them to capture prey, because the prey on the surface would not see the predators underneath, so that in this way, if an insect walked nearby on the surface, then the predators underground would sense the kind of septal vibration and move quickly to the source of the vibration and then prop up all of the sudden to catch the insect in surprise.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "030", "audio_file": "1_01.mp3"}}

When harmful back to rose, it's not that contributes to the moment of plant spaces from one area to another. Because when a new plant spaces get into a new area, where this place will compete for resource-based estate in plant life. For example, in California, a reacquarded yellow star hostel, this deal would distribute to the new area by tires. This puts the star hostel in competition for water. It's the original plant life, which means the harder for the native plants to survive. Also, the rose can affect the barrier and drive a divide up when animals have eaten to small ones.

One is that it would cause the movement of plants, especially cause some problems to existing plants.

For example, when the starfish of seeds were first introduced to the new area, they would have the competition over natural resources, like the water and other natural resources. The species may be threatened and can be not survived.

The first one is that roads can contribute movement of sun species to another place. And it will cause problems to the native species because the new plants will compete for some resource. For example, on storces and it will just type the car in road and to a new area. So this will just compete with the native species for the resources such as water. It's hard for the native species to survive.

Construction has on our environment, the first one is that roads have some plans to move from one area to another, and the megarounds plans become a trouble for existing plants in the area, because the new commerce will compete with the local species for resources. A good example is the yellow star stretches in California. When there were cars driving down the road, the season of yellow starfish goes stuck in the terrace and was then carried to New Arris. They didn't compete with local species, which made it harder for local species to survive. Another is the busy highways have become barriers for animals, and they drive up animals' habitats in smaller ones, where they're really easy in some ways to support their animal population.

The first one is that the roads usually contribute to the more severe competition like the California, where it's usually distributed to new areas. As an example, in the recording, the competition with native spaces about water, raw materials, and other resources just become more and more significant. And the second negative part of the roads is that they usually create barriers of size of a specific area. And those native spaces and animals living in this region usually don't have enough food to feed themselves. Like a kind of box, which is an example in the recording, they usually have small animals that spread in large regions and areas.

As a start, she said it would contribute to the movement of plants. To elaborate, new plants would compete with resources with original plants. For example, the yellow star litho. When the seeds of the yellow star litho was stuck by the car and moved to a new place, it would compete water with native plants. So, it is really hard for native plants to survive. Second, she said it would create a barrier. That is to say, it would smaller the animals habitat, because animals would be afraid to cross it. They would not have enough food to eat at that time. For instance, the kid boxes. Kid boxes would like to hunt small animals in wide open grasslands. As a result, the number of the kid boxes would decrease if they can get enough food.

The first way that after species was moved from one place to another is to compete with local resources, for example. After wheat was brought by the tire of trucks to California, they start to compete with local species for resources such as water and thus make local species difficult to survive. The second way is that the habitat area of animals becomes smaller and smaller because busy roads with fast passing by cars and tracks make animals so afraid to pass through.

You can find new plans, especially if you move from one area to another. The new plans compete with existing plant life resources. It should provide an example of yellow stack resources. If the yellow stack resources get stopped through tires, the seats are distributed to new areas and instead of competing with existing plans for natural resources as results, these plans might decline. The cars on the routes act as boundaries to animals and as result, animals are afraid to cross by reacts, especially animals that requires large expanse of land to find which provides an example of key boxes. These boxes won't cause more animals to explore the visually spread around the area. So because of these cars, key boxes might not be able to get enough food.

One way, if the road construction creates extra movement of one plant species to another area, and this introduction of new species would make it harder for original plant species to survive. For example, California yellow star thistle, their seeds were introduced to another habitat during road construction. After they germinate, they compete with original plant species for water and other nutrients. Another way is that road construction can serve as barrier the device up habitat, and this would make it harder for animals to search for sufficient food. For example, kid foxes living in south western United States feeds on small animals like mouse and squirrels to survive.

One is by moving new species into current location during the road building or the transportation. So the existing species will fight with a new coming species with natural resources.

So actually it will cause them to lose their lives and start losing the place. The second is the kickfox because the new road divided their feeding zone into smaller pieces.

Well, the first way is that it will have some influence on the movement of the species from one space to another. In the condition that some new species were introduced to another places, they were competing with a computer with existing ones for the necessary resources. Like in California, the yellow star-free coat was stored or stuck by the road. So the seeds were moved to another place. They compete for water in some other resources with native ones, as a result, native ones suffer a lot. On top of that, the roads will decrease the habitat era for some animal species. So they will have less access to enough food, since they are shut down in some small piece of land. For example, the kid folks praise more animals, which spread around large grassland.

First, it can tribute the movement of the plants, because sometimes it can be introduced to other places, which those plants will compete for the resources with the plants that are already there, which is actually not beneficial. The example the president took was a kind of plant, a kind of wheat, in California called stardustole, and sometimes their seeds will be like the wheat. Meanwhile, blow their seeds to other places, and they will compete for the water with the local plants, which is actually make harder for the local plants to survive. And the second way is the roads exist as barriers. The animals cannot find food, since they are afraid of a cross these barriers. An example was the kind of kid fox, and those fox relies on hunting small animals that is living in the large areas, and without that their amount has been decreased a lot.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "032", "audio_file": "1_19.mp3"}}

The first negative effect is that it causes the distribution of certain species to different places. As an example, there's a kind of yellow star fissos that are distributed to other places since they are stuck into the tires of cars. Well, because of that, the native plants that live in those areas are well-declined rapidly, since they do not have enough food. Actually, that is because the fissos took most of the food. Also, these rose divided animals' habitats into smaller ones. Well, since because of that, some of the animals that rely on larger landscapes to find food actually decried. As an example, just a kind of kid fox, they mainly feed us more animals like rabbits that are distributed into large places.

First of all, you know, these roles contribute to the moment of plans from one place to another place, unless new plans would compete with the native plans. For instance, in California, Star Wars So would be stark in cars and be brought to another place, and this new plan would compete with the native plans for natural resources like water. So the native plans could be difficult to survive. Besides, you know, highways could divide all the habitats of animals to be very small places, so they can't get enough food. And for instance, the kickbox is fading on mice and squirrels, which are living in big lands. Due to the highways, the population of kickbox declined a lot because of the lack of food.

The first way is that the paved roads will be harmful to plants because it helps the plants to move from one place to another. The new plants would compete for resources with existing plants.

The impact of the paved roads is to animals. Their habitats are divided by paved roads. So the animals are scared to cross the road and look for food. For example, the number of kit foxes is reducing because they do not have enough prey such as mice and squirrels.

The professor used example of wheat and foxes to illustrate this concept. Firstly, the movement of plants species would do harm to the native plants, because they would compete with them on native resource for weeds and example, when they are introduced to a new environment, they would compete with the native plants. Also, animals, they are influenced by this as well, because animals, they always need to find food in a large area, but now they are limited in a certain area, because they are afraid to cross the roads, such as the foxes, they always eat small animals, but now they are restricted in such a small area, and they could not have enough food resources.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "032", "audio_file": "1_23.mp3"}}

Secondly, the professor mentioned that the road construction will be devoted to the one road to the left. To be more specific, he has taken the cataphorox, for an example. The cataphorox, which goes to hunt for food aspirating over a great area of grassland, is limited into a small area because of the road boundary.

But on the other hand, those are ranges that grow around the areas may get suffered because they have to compete with those exotic seas on natural resources. Another way is that they provide these barriers and it may provide happy tasks of some small animals that generally have very large habitats.

There are mainly two reasons for a fast road concern however, the first one is that roads have some plans to move on from one area to another and migrant plans can become trouble for you to see it in an area because the newcomers will compete with the local species for resources. A good example is the yellow star's vehicle in California. When there were cars driving down the road, the states of the yellow star's vehicle got stuck in the tires and were then carried to new areas. They then competed with local species, which made it harder for local species to survive. Another is that these highways have become barriers for animals and they divide up animals' habits into smaller ones, where they usually isn't enough food to support animal population. For example, the keyfox that fits on mice and squirrels now get shot in smaller areas for highways and cannot get their food despair over the grassland.

In this case, franchising can be a very good way for companies to follow. It means to open a range of the already existing company and be part of it. And doing this has mainly two advantages. First, the big company can offer you training and plan for you to follow. For example, for a Tisa restaurant, the headquarters can send people to your restaurant and teach you how to cook, how to operate, give you all necessary training. And second advantage is that you have to establish the customer base. For example, if you are operating a business restaurant under big name, you already have a loyalty customers.

The first is that you and your employees would get training from the company. You don't have to come up with your own business but just follow the one given by the company.

It has several advantages that verbats and many discuss two of them. The first one is that established companies provide training to you and your employees and a plan to follow. For example, if you want to run a pizza restaurant by French Rising. The company you have paid will send someone to your restaurant to teach you and your employees how to prepare the pizza, how to take the food. There are others in how to run a restaurant, so your restaurant is running exactly like other divisions.

The first is that the established company will come to give you and your employees certain trainees to tell you how to run this kind of business and they will give a business plan for you to follow. So you don't have to come up with one that you come up with yourself and take the pizza restaurant for example, the company will come and tell you how to prepare a pizza, how to arrange all the orders and how to run the rental restaurant by yourself. And the second advantage of Frenchism is that it can establish certain customer base for you because people will come to the restaurant because they're just confident about this place since they have been to this pizza restaurant before in some other location. And when you open a new restaurant in different locations, they will still come because they have a good experience in the past. So they know your pizza will be as good as those restaurants.

For example, they will send someone at the opening ceremony and train the people. For example, how to prepare the food and take orders. And even how to operate the business. The second advantage is you can use the current existing customer base because you have the same name with the well-known company. So the customers have confidence in the product's quality.

In the first place, she says that French-facing can provide you with trainings to other employees in terms of all aspects of business and offers you plans in order to be success. For example, if you would wind up new the version of a pizza restaurant, French-facing will offer you training to how to prepare a pizza and how to make field orders and in the second place, French-facing will provide you with established customer loyalty because you have the same company name so that customers just trust you and are confident in the quality of your food and your services. For example, if you opened up a pizza restaurant of the same name in near location of a really famous pizza restaurant, customer will just simply trust you because they have good experience in the other restaurant.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "033", "audio_file": "1_23.mp3"}}

There are two advantages of Frenchizing. First of all, the existing company will provide you with their training process to train your employees and you don't need to come up with the business plan in your own. For example, if you open a restaurant which sells pizza, but you have to worry about a business plan to follow. However, if you open a branch of an existing name, then they will provide and then they will send some people to a restaurant and teach you how to operate the business, how to prepare the food, for example.

First, the counseling can help you to train both you and your employees in all aspects of business. That means you don't have to do that of your own. They can help you to set up a plan for you to follow. For example, if you're opening a new piece of restaurant, they can help you to train your employees how to prepare the pieces and how to deal with the orders. Secondly, seems to be a famous company has already a large customer base, which means they have a large amount of loyal customers, which will follow them. And we are opening a new piece in the new location. And you're using the same name and same brand of the company. And customers are confident about your company because they trust this company.

There are two advantages about franchising. The first is a company that is going to provide sufficient training for the new business, so that the new business is going to have a solid plan for success. For example, if you are going to start a restaurant which sells pizzas, then the company will going to send somebody to train you about how to make pizza and how to make a decent business. And the second advantage is about franchising in that you will have a loyal customer base and they are all going to be confident of the quality of the product. For example, you are going to sell pizzas. Then when people notice that you are only a shop with the same name of a big company, the new location, then people will know the reputation of the big brand, so they will trust in the product.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "033", "audio_file": "1_27.wav"}}

Well, the first one is the environment which is in the aridity. Well, environment a lot of moisture can probably restrain the decay rates and thus prevent bacteria from growing. Well, for example, there's kind of wall paintings found in the desert, and they're harder on that wall painting is still bright as today's. And the other one is the environment which is lack of oxygen.

Well, the first kind of strategy it used when the sun comes out, well, none they can actually get into the shade of plants. And well, since the ground, where they act, where they hide, on can be heated up, they'll transport themselves to somewhere else, like under the tree, where the sun cannot bridge them, and well, the entire climate is well cooler than the other parts of the planet. Secondly, well, they can secrete a sticky thing that is combined by well calcium to shield himself as a natural barrier.

The lecturers provide an example with snails. Snails are common animals who have body shells. So, in order to avoid the heat during summer, when the sun comes up, they will just move to the vegetation under it, like under its shell. And also when the ground is hot, they will go off ground, so they will go into thick themselves in a tree or something else. In another way, if they're trying to not dry out during the summer, they will just use a secure substance covering their shell and keep its moisture inside. During that time, they will also slow their body metabolism and just stay in the shell for a really long time until the temperature is dropped.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "036", "audio_file": "1_04.wav"}}

The first way is to move under vegetation such as leaf where there is shade. In the summer, the ground is always hotter, so the snails will move to cooler places such as attaching them to a wall rather than stay on the ground. Another way is to secrete substance which prevents them from drying out. They create substance such as calcium to cover them in a shell and they enclose them in the shell as well. This way they are able to keep moisture in a shell so that they can prevent drying out. They can stay in the shell for a long time such as for a few months. And the body is still down all the activity so that there is no need for them to find food and they are able to survive.

First is about avoiding heat. The snails can move up to a shelter of vegetation, such as plants and leaves, which makes them get out of sand and move into shade. And when the ground is really hot because it's observed radiation of sand, they will leave this place and go to something very cooler, such as water. Second is about avoiding drying out due to lack of water. In some summer days, snails can produce some sticky slim substance, which can cover over shells to make them close up and keep the moisture inside of this body for long period of time. Because the whole body has slowed down and don't need much food to eat, the food store in the shell already is", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "036", "audio_file": "1_06.mp3"}}

They will hide in shelters of vegetation, in shade of vegetation. And in addition, they will also attach to cool places, such as trees and walls instead of the ground, which is quite hot. And the second thing they will do is try to avoid dry out because of the lack of water. For example, they constantly create very sticky substitutions and then cover the opening of their shells and close their shells. We can stay inside their shells for a long time, even for a month. And in addition, their bodies can slow down, so they can depend on the food they have already stored before. Until the next rain, they will open their shells to absorb water and to find an extra food. So in these two ways, the snail can have already developed a special strategies in order to avoid heat and also to avoid drying out, which could be quite fatal to them.

While the second strategy prevents them from drying out in summer months, when it's so hot, they will produce a sticky substance in their shells, which could prevent moisture from drying up. So they will hide themselves, hide their body in their shells, and could keep for several months. At that moment, a high-quality arm is in slow-down, so snails don't need to find food.

A snail has developed two main strategies. The aim of this first strategy is to avoid the heat. Snails will move up to show her with cover by vegetation that makes them get away from the sun and prevent the heat. Because the ground is hotter exposed to sunlight, snails will touch into a wall or to a tree to get colder. This second strategy is about keeping themselves most sure. When it becomes dry, snails will begin to produce a kind of substance to fill a shell. That can keep it more in store inside the shell than living on the food store in the shell. After several months when there are more waters, snails will come out if they shell again.

The first of the ways of the snails, you know, surviving is that as they always found a strong place to hide from the sunlight. And she mentioned that it could be some of the ways that over the shadows by the leaves or trees. And, you know, the ground is always out in the radiative of the heat. So they could have just got a wide amount of attention to the ground directly and attached to the wool in the trees. So that could be patterned for them. And, secondly, as you mentioned, they also have to worry about of the drowns of the water. So when the climate is too high, they're just the sacred and the kind of slimy substance to, you know, cover the opening of the shell and just hiding the kind of a serious base. And in this way, they could have just a main-to-act complement. And when the climate's got a rainy again, just get out and get some water.

The first one is that they will avoid the heat. Snails will get into vegetation areas like trees or plants in order to get in shade. Therefore, those places are not so hot like walls or trees. These places are cooler than ground. Another strategy is that Snails will avoid being drying out. Especially in summer seasons. Snails will excrete a substance which is sticky and including calcium. These substance will cover the shells of the snails and keep the moisture inside the shell. Snails can stay in their shells for a long time like several months and everything like metabolism in the snails will be slowed down. Therefore, snails are able to survive during this hard period.

The first one is painters may start using photography as a tool to help them paint more realistically. For instance, now painters will be able to depict a moving object or some fleeing moments. In order to paint lags of a running horse, painters can use a camera so they will know the exact positions of lags in the mid-air. Another influence is that painters may decide to change their painting styles. So different from what is realistic, painters may adopt some abstract styles to distinguish their own artwork from photography. So in that case, when doing portraits of people, painters may adopt some unnatural skin tones like green, purple, blue and apply them to people's faces.

For example, when they draw the leg of a horse, they can capture the exact position of the horse leg. They can draw more realistically. The second way that the photography has affected painting is that they help develop an abstract way for painters to draw.

However, they can actually take photos of that thing, or smoothing, so that it can be used as a base for their painting. As an example, if a painter wants to draw a house sleeping in the air, they can take a photo of it, and then use a photo as a base in order to draw a realistic painting.

As the economies of ancient civilizations developed over time and became more complex, certain changes tended to occur.\nLet's talk about a couple of the changes that happened as the economies of ancient civilizations developed.\nOne of the key economic changes was in the way that people paid for goods and services.\nAs their civilizations developed,\nmany began to use currency ...\nuh...money\nto pay for goods and services, rather than trading with each other.\nA monetary system made it easier to make purchases...\nbecause people could buy from anyone,\nnot just those who wanted to trade.\nSo, for example, say a man who baked bread wanted a new coat.\nWell, with a monetary system, the man could buy a new coat from the coat maker with money.\nThis was better than trading,\nbecause the coat maker might not want to trade a coat for the bread maker's bread.\nNow another economic change was that ancient civilizations began to acquire items from far away.\nIn the past, people would only trade locally ...\nbut as their civilizations developed,\nthey began trading with other people in distant places...\nso they were able to acquire goods they wouldn't have otherwise.\nFor example, the ancient Romans never had silk fabric...\nuntil they started trading with the Chinese,\nwho lived a great distance from them.\nOnce the Romans started traveling far away, to China,\nthey could acquire silk...\nwhich was highly prized by the Romans because you just couldn't get it anywhere nearby.\n考生回答：Well, the first change was in the way people paid for goods and services. Before the development of economy, they made use of a barter system, which means that if you want to get products or service from other people, you treat with them directly with your own products. But after the monetary system, which means you pay for other goods and services with currency or money, you can basically get anything you want. Because in the past, for example, if you sell bread for a living and you want to get a coat from a coat maker, the problem is that the coat maker might not want to treat with you to get your bread. But with the money, it is easier for you to get what you want. The second change is that people start to acquire items from faraway places. The sort of stuff that they wouldn't get from local places. For example, the ancient Roman could get the silk fabric from Chinese, which is a certain distance away from them.

One is the way that people pay for goods and services. They will use currency instead of cheating. This would greatly help people to enjoy your convenience life. For example, if people who bake the bread want a new coat, he would like to just buy the coat from the coat maker use currency instead of the bread. It is more convenient because the coat maker may do not want bread and meat. The second change is that people would acquire items from far away. In the past, people may just want to do cheating locally, but if they have currency or other things, they would buy things in a decent place. The older Romans would buy the silk from Chinese with a very high price in the changes of civilization. But in the past, they could only trade things locally and can never get the silk from China this far away.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "038", "audio_file": "1_02.mp3"}}

One key economic change is that people began to buy items from each other with currency instead of trading directly with their own goods. This was because basic monetary system had been established. For example, if a bread maker wanted to get a new code, he or she could justify a new code from the code maker. In this scenario, not want any bread. Another change is that people began to acquire items from far away places. In the past, people only traded locally, but after people began to travel to just some places like ancient Romans began to travel to China, they can get items in far away places like silk and fabrics, which was very highly prized because they just couldn't", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "038", "audio_file": "1_03.mp3"}}

The first one is the way that people pay for goods and services. People begin to use currency rather than treated with each other. And the monetary system made it easier for anyone to purchase. For example, if Bradmaker wanted to buy a new coat, he couldn't pay the coat maker with money. Otherwise, the coat maker may not want to treat with a Bradmaker's bread. The second one is that people could acquire items far away, even possibly only treated locally. However, as the development of civilizations, they could acquire things they didn't have in distant places. For example, in ancient Romans, people didn't have silk fabric and here they traveled far to China. And those silk were bought with highly pressed since they couldn't get it nearby.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "038", "audio_file": "1_04.mp3"}}

First is that the way people pay for product and services is that they use currency to trade with this monetary system to trade with other people instead of buying things from other people instead of trading with them. This is better than trading because they can buy everything from anyone who provides the products or services. And second is that people started to acquire items from far away. Like in Asian times where Romans do not have silk fabric, therefore they have to buy silks from China. But China is so far away. Therefore, the products they bought from China are silks. It was very expensive. And that's how they have to trade with Chinese because they want to buy those", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "038", "audio_file": "1_05.mp3"}}

The first one is about the way that people used to make their payment. In the past, people tend to use barter system. That says people could trade with each other with their own items. And then the monetary system has been invited. People get to use currency like the money to trade with each other. And it is a much easier way because people could buy from each other only use money. For example, the bread maker who wants to buy a coat for himself, he could use money to buy it from the coat maker directly. However, in the past, the bread maker could only use bread to trade with the coat worker. And if the coat worker doesn't want any bread, then the bread maker end up has nothing. And the second change is about required items from far away. That says people get to trade with people who live in long distance. For example, the Asian-German who doesn't have a silver silkish.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "038", "audio_file": "1_06.wav"}}

The first one is the way the people pay goods. People start using currents or money instead of simply you just trade between each other. And the example was that if a bread man, like someone making bread, wants neither coat, in the old satiety they need to just simply trade with the one who made coat. However, if the man who made coats does not want the bread, there's going to be a problem. However, in the monetary society, they have currents. So the bread man can just sell the bread and get money to buy the coat. And the second change is the request for the goods from far away. And the example was that the Romans does not need like the surgery many years before. However, since they have started to travel and trade with Chinese, they knew it and they started to request even for like silks since they are able to get it and they can go far away to trade for them.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "038", "audio_file": "1_07.mp3"}}

And the first one is that people in that time could pay for goods and services using currency rather than trade with bargain system. So in monetary system, people could buy from virtually anyone. For example, if a man made bread wanted to get a code in monetary system, he could just virtually buy it from a code maker. However, in the bargain system, he had to, you know, he may not get it because the code maker may not want his bread. And the second change is that items from far away could now be attained rather than, you know, people in the ancient times could only trade goods locally. However, if they're using monetary system and trade, they could have the, you know, goods from far away places like China. For example, Roman Empire didn't have fried soup fabric until they began to trade with China. And when they have contacted China for the first time, they would have buy the, you know, silk from high price because they don't have it before.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "038", "audio_file": "1_08.mp3"}}

The first is that when people create for goods and services, many people use currency to pay for goods rather than trading. For instance, if a man that takes bread is interested in buying a coat, he would use money to buy the coat because the person that sells bread might not be interested in the trade exchange. And second is that they were able to acquire items from fire, for example, trade things from far instance, is able to acquire things that they would not have. For instance, rumors are quite silk fabric and they had to travel all far away. And this silk was highly priced by rumors because you can't get it anywhere nearby.

In the past, people would trade with each other in order to buy something that is called a bartering system. But now it is with the development of currency. It is much easier for people to make deals. For example, if a banker wants to buy a coat, in the past, he needed to trade in a coat for brass. But now he didn't have to do so. He can just buy a coat with the money. The second change is that it's easier for people now to make long-distance trades. For example, in Asian Romans, people in the past, because they couldn't produce silk and other fabrics. Therefore, they need to buy something from China, buy silk from China. And because of this, now it is much easier for them to make this kind of trace instead of just making deals with the local people.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "038", "audio_file": "1_10.mp3"}}

It's much easier to buy things. For example, if a bread maker wanted to get a cow ticket, use the money to buy one. Otherwise, Kim might be refused to buy the cop maker because the cop maker didn't want the bread that he made. By items from different places, people used to trade only locally, but as the civilization developed, they started to acquire goods from different places that they might not have.

The way people pay for goods or service has been changed. Initially, it was paid by through trade. After the civilization have developed, people devised a monetary system to pay for the goods, which is much more easier. For example, a brand maker could buy the coat from the coat maker using the monetary systems. From both the quantitative and quantitative perspectives, the examples mentioned by a professor provides sufficient evidence. Not only because it gives a detailed explanation of the situation, but also it represents one of the most characteristic applications of the theory. Another changes is that the way people acquire items. People can buy items which is far away from it. In this way, the limits of distance can be bricked. It can be broken.

Many beneficial things the coat maker might not want to buy the bread. The second development is that people were able to acquire items far away. In the past, people could only try it locally. However, as time passes by, they could even buy products from people lived far away. For example, in the past, Roman people were not able to get silk fabric until they traded with Chinese who lived in great distance.

The first one is the way that people pay for goods and services. In parts, they trade with other people by using their own goods. However, with the invention of the monetary system, they can use a currency to buy the goods instead of trading. For instance, a person selling the bread for a living can use a currency to buy the code from the code maker. However, in parts, they only traded with the code maker by using the bread. However, sometimes the code maker didn't want the bread. The second way is that people can acquire items from far away places, the distant places. In parts, they can only acquire items locally. For instance, the Romans imported the fabric from the China of distant places in Oriental of Asia. Of course, it cannot get fabrics and silk.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "038", "audio_file": "1_15.mp3"}}

For example, the first key economic change is a change on the way to pay for goods or services. People began to use currency, which makes purchases more convenient. For instance, a man who cooked bread won't buy a new coat. With the monetary system, he just need to pay the coat maker with money. Rather than trading goods with him, as the coat maker might not want bread from the bread maker. The second change is to acquire items from places far away, which is quite important for the development of civilization. People started to trade with people from a great distance. For example, ancient Romans started to buy fabric from Chinese. Once they travel far away to China, they cannot only get fabric, but also buy silk, which they couldn't get anywhere nearby.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "038", "audio_file": "1_16.wav"}}

The first is to use currency to pay for goods instead of just trading with other people. So it can be easier purchase, which means you can buy things from everywhere instead of just trading. For example, if a black maker want to code, before they make trade, with a code maker, but higher, the code maker does not really, maybe, may not want a bread, so it will be more convenient. The second key point is it can trade with someone far away instead of just locally. So for example, when the room and room has a fabric and here trading with Chinese, it can require silk.

The first big change is about the way people pay. People gradually develop the habit to trade with currency like money rather than trading goods. For example, if a bread baker wants to buy a new coat, he can purchase it with money rather than buy it with a spread. It's much more convenient for him to do so because it's possible that the coat maker doesn't want to spread and in that way it will be impossible for him to trade it. And the second change is about that the people who originally only do low-coat trade can have the ability to acquire items which is far away. For example, the woman citizen who cannot produce fiber, travel a long way to China and buy silk then back to where they came from, sold it in a high price.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "038", "audio_file": "1_19.mp3"}}

The first way is that T4 began to change their ways to pay for the goods and services. They began to use the currency instead of trading to buy from the goods and services from anyone. For example, for people who have bred or would like to buy some clothes, now they could just ask for the code makers and then give them the money.

Well, the first changes is that well people started to use currency to pay for things, rather than trading with each other. But that is able to make them trade with more variety of people, since well trading is limited to people who want that good. As an example, if a brand maker wants a new coach, in the past, he would well just trade bread with the coach maker. But well, chances are high that the coach maker does not want bread and that deal will be eliminated. However, now they can actually use currency to pay for that coach by selling his bread.

The second one is that you can buy things from the place far away rather than locally.

With the monetary system, people could use money to pay for such items, which we facilitated the whole process, because they can buy stuff from anyone. For example, a bride, a man who baked a bride could buy a coat from a coat maker. And this was better than trading, because the coat maker probably didn't want the bride in which they could buy a coat maker. And the second change was that people could acquire items from faraway places. For example, in the past, people could only trade locally. But now, with the economic development, they could trade with people who live in a distant place. For example, Asian elements have allowed the silk fabric. And when they travel to China, they may trade with the Chinese people to acquire silk.

If the bread man wants a new code, he can just buy the code from the code maker rather than trade with the code maker using his bread. Because it is a better way, because the bread man that the code man may not want the bread at that time. And the second way of the change in economy in ancient civilization is that people can require items from a faraway place, not only from the local location, but from location in a long distance. And take the ancient romance, for example. Silk is to be really expensive in ancient women.

The first economic change is the way people buy goods and services. People use currencies and money to buy products instead of cheating with each other. For example, if a baker wants a new coat, you could use money to buy a coat directly from the killmaker. It's a better way than cheating because the killmaker might not want some bread and then exchange for his coat. The second change is that people could acquire items from far away in the past, people could only trade locally. However, as the civilization developed, they could trade waste people from a great distance. For example, the Romans never had silk, but after trading with the Chinese people who lived far from them, they could have silk and they value silk highly.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "038", "audio_file": "1_27.mp3"}}

The changes which have occurred during ancient civilization are the first one is the key economic change that is paid for the goods and services as a civilization developed. Many became to use money instead of using trading. A monetary made it easier to buy anything from anyone. For example, a man made trade and wanted to have a new food maker. So I can buy the new food maker instead of having the bread to buy from the bread. Another thing is that they acquire item from far away. Earlier they used to bring a broad item locally but they have a far item for far away. For example, the soap fabric was not available locally.

It is a better way than trading since the one who had the coat may not want the bread for trading. And the second change is that people started to acquire items from far away instead of locally.

First, he is trying to emphasize some special features to convince the customer to believe that what they are going to pay really weren't money. For instance, if they are doing the business in an electronic store, the customer is concerned about the price of a new laptop. Instead of telling whether this is cheaper, the salesman may just focus on some very strong features. For instance, it's really fast and they can get to work down quickly, which can save your time in turn. And the second strategy is try to demonstrate it right in front of the customer as a direct way to address all the concerns. Again, back to the examples in the electronic store. If the customer concerned about the portability, the salesman could just pack it up, put it in a backpack and play on his shoulder. You can use it on the meat.

This means showing the laptop to the customer, maybe the customer was concerned about how expensive it is.

Firstly, the salesperson can use some special features to outweigh the consumer's concerns. Firstly, the professor uses an example of electronics store. The salesperson wants to sell the laptop, however, the consumer's main thing is too expensive. So the salesperson can use the information of how fast the laptop is. To outweigh the problem that the consumers previously explained, which will be worth a price that consumers are likely to buy. Secondly, the salesperson can demonstrate a feature by using it from all the consumers, which the professor uses the same example of a electronics store. The consumer may raise the concern of how portable the laptop is, so the salesperson can unplug the computer into a carrying case and send the shoulder to show that it is easy to transport and it will be a solution to address the concerns.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "040", "audio_file": "1_12.mp3"}}

For example, the customers want to buy the laptop, but the price is very expensive, so the salesmen say that it is very fast and can work be done in a really short time. The customer will delay the special feature and buy it. The second one is that the salesperson can demonstrate the product in front of the customers. For example, the customers want to buy the laptop, but they do not know whether the laptop is purple or not, so the salesmen show it to them, such as carrying the case and selling over their shoulders and show that it is easy to transform, so the customer will buy it.

One is that children can feel being controlled when they're playing because they always feel themselves really helpless and they depend on their parents too much. However, while playing, they can be fully in control to decide what's toy to play and how to play with them. So for example, when they're building blocks, they will not feel so helpless because they can construct it by themselves. And also another reason is that children can explore desires and urges without harming their parents. For example, when they're just playing these blocks, they can just easily smash those towers they can build and which is really common. So in this way, their parents won't be upset because when they're making a mess, their parents will get annoyed and it is natural for them.", "output": "4.0分", "meta": {"problem_id": "041", "audio_file": "1_01.wav"}}

The first one is that they can feel more in control instead of helpless. Basically, they depend on adults and have little control over their own lives, because parents decide everything for them, including eating and wearing, which makes them feel uneasy and anxious. While in play, they are able to control like decide the right toys and how to play with them, or use building blocks to construct something with no help at all. Let me find a safe way to explore desires that are not acceptable. Typically, for example, all kids have the urge to be destructive, but if they act on it by really breaking things or messing up or running house, their parents may get upset. Children are curious, but don't want to piece their parents off, so play could solve this problem by allowing these behaviors, like to build a tower and then smash it all down, which is destructive, but without any harm done.", "output": "4.0分", "meta": {"problem_id": "041", "audio_file": "1_02.mp3"}}

The first reason is because during play, the children would feel much more in control. For example, children depend on their parents pretty much for everything. Their parents decide what to eat, where to eat, and what to drink. However, during play, the children can decide how to play and what to play. So by doing this, the children will feel much more in control. The second reason is because during play, they can safely explore some certain urges, like disruptive behavior. For example, the children will get punished by their parents if they knock something over at their house. However, during play, the children can totally just build up a tower and smash it out down afterwards without being punished by their parents. That's why a play is very important for a child's development.", "output": "3.8分", "meta": {"problem_id": "041", "audio_file": "1_03.mp3"}}

However during play they can control their own world. For example, if a child has a plane with some building blocks, he can construct something without any help, so they can feel being in control. The second one that the plane can be a safe way for children to explore a certain desire, which might not be as acceptable in real life like to break down something and mess up the house, which might get their parents' upside. However, by playing they can act as such a destructive behavior. For example, a child can build a tower and then machine it down. This destructive behavior will have no harm in playing.", "output": "3.8分", "meta": {"problem_id": "041", "audio_file": "1_04.mp3"}}

She uses two examples to illustrate it. So the first point is that playing makes children feel more in control. When children are small, they are often helpless because they depend too much on their parents. But when they are playing, they can fully decide what they are going to play with and how they are going to play with it. If they are building a block, it totally depends on them to build anything they want. And the second point is that playing is a safe way for children to explore several urges. For example, children are tended to be destructive. Yet they can't destroy things in their home because it will make their parents nervous. In contrast, children can easily build a tower and smash it down. This is a common phenomenon. And it unleash children's urges on destruct things without causing any real problems. So that's why play is important for a child's development.", "output": "3.8分", "meta": {"problem_id": "041", "audio_file": "1_05.mp3"}}

The first way that the play helps children feel more in control, since more children have to depend on adults. So they often feel helpless, uneasy, and anxious. So when they play, they can be in control. They can't decide which toy they are going to play and how to play with it. Sometimes they take building blocks and make a building out of them without any help. Another reason that play gives children a safe way to explore certain urges and desires. For example, kids may take the urge to be destructive. So by being destructive, during play, their parents won't get upset. Like some kids will build a tower and mash it all down. And that's the two benefits that children could receive during play.", "output": "3.8分", "meta": {"problem_id": "041", "audio_file": "1_06.mp3"}}

Firstly, it can help children feel more in control. Little children always feel helpless. Almost their everything are depending on their parents, what to eat, which to wear. But when they are playing with their toys, they can totally choose which place to play, which toys to play, how to play with such toys.

Firstly, that play helps the children for more in control. As is mentioned by many psychologists, the small child often felt helpless because they depend their lives on others, especially their parents, and their parents decide when they eat, what they eat. So, they feel uneasy and anxious. But when play, they are able to control their own world. Like voting blogs, they can distract something without any help. And second, play gives the children a safe way to explore their certain desires, like the urge to be destructive. If they do this in the home and messes other things, their parents will get upset. But by playing, they will totally allow to be destructive. For example, it's very common to say that one child built a tower and smashed it down immediately when the tower finished.", "output": "3.8分", "meta": {"problem_id": "041", "audio_file": "1_08.mp3"}}

For example, small keys often fail helpless because they always rely on parents and they get little control over themselves. However, when they are engaged in play they can actually decide which toy and how a toy should be played and gradually they can gain control over themselves without relying on other persons. Secondly, it's also a safe way to explore the children's own urges and desires. For example, children has this natural instinct to be destructive however they are not normally allowed to do so because parents will be unhappy. However, during the play they can actually safely, for example, smash a building block with actually doing any harm to it or to themselves.

Why? Because it took so long to reach consensus. It took many many meetings to build agreement among group members about how they would move the project along. On the other hand, there were other instances where one or two people managed to become very influential over what their group did. Sometimes when those inferences said this would never work. About an idea that I was developing, that it was quickly dropped instead of being further discussed. And then there was another occasion when a cup of influencer invconvinced a group that a plan of theirs are highly concreative.

So firstly, when they're playing they can have a flow of in control without being helpless because they currently depend on their apartment to a large extent and they have little control about themselves such as what to eat. However, when they're playing they have a control of what they're going to play and how they're going to play with such as they can decide how to play the building blocks and they will not feel helpless. The main benefit is that the play offers them a safe way to express their order to be destructive. As we know, children like destructive things because they want to explore and they're always curious. And during the play such as when they're playing the building blocks they can smash the building blocks without harm after they have built them. So their parents don't need to be worried about and this offers them a safe way to be destructive and they can explore things around them.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "041", "audio_file": "1_12.mp3"}}

The first is that it will make students feel more in control.

However, by playing they can feel more control of the world around them. They can decide which tour to play with. How to play with the tour. They can also to build blocks without help from others. The second reason is that they can find a safe way to explore their design and urge like the destructive.

First, it might help the child to build a sense of being in control and get rid of the sense of helplessness because the child is wholly dependent on other people like his or her parents for everything and everything is decided by the parents and this would give the children a kind of sense of uneasiness and anxiety. However, by choosing which toys to play with and how to play the toys, the child would definitely have a sense of being in control of everything. And the second way is that it would help them to find a safe way to explore urges and desires that are usually deemed as social taboo. For example, they want to explore their production for being destructive and because the children are actually curious, you can't stop them from being destructive. But however, by playing toys, by building a tower and then smashing those, explore it without being harmful.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "041", "audio_file": "1_14.mp3"}}

The first reason is that playing gives a child a sense of being in control. Small children, especially, they often feel hopeless because they have to depend on the dogs for multiple things. They can't decide what they can eat and when to eat, so they often feel a sense of loss to control and that gives them an feeling of uneasiness and anxiety. So, through playing, they can decide which toy to play and how to play with it, thus enabling them to feel that they are actually constructing something by themselves. The second reason is that playing is a safe way to deal with certain urges that may not be appreciated. So, for instance, like the urge to be destructive, the children are born to be curious about the environment and they want to mess around the house, but the parents will not be appreciated by that. So, what they want to do through playing is that they smash it and that is okay.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "041", "audio_file": "1_15.wav"}}

First is that the play can give children a sense of being in control. For example, the kids usually don't have control over their own life. They can easily feel helpless because adults have total control over what they are going to play, what they want and where they are going to eat. So during play, they can have control over their own way. Like to choose which or how to play, which toy to play and how to play with it or build some towers and buildings. And another is that the play can give a safe age for the desire to distract. We can see children has a prone to distract something and they are prone to be destructive to break something down. But during play, they are allowed to do so. So it's really common.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "041", "audio_file": "1_16.mp3"}}

First, play makes kids feel more in control. Most children often feel helpless. They have to depend on other people for everything. Parents decide what they eat, what they eat, or what they wear. The developmental dependency makes kids uneasy and anxious. When kids play, they are able to decide which toy they are going to play with and how they're going to play with it. Maybe they make some blocks and make a building out of the second. Play gives children a pathway to explore certain urges. They have but ones that don't represent acceptable like urges to be destructive. The kids are curious and they want to explore what it's like to be destructive without making their parents outside. In play, they are allowed to be destructive. For example, it's common to see a kid build a tower and then just smash it out.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "041", "audio_file": "1_17.mp3"}}

The first way is to help children feel in control. Because young children often feel helpless because they have to depend on a doubt for everything. But in the word of play, for example, they can choose which toy they play with and how to play with the toy. Also, when they are building something using building blocks, they are basically constructing something without anyone else's help. This gives children a feeling of being controlled, which is good for their emotional development. And secondly, playing offers children a safe way to express their urges and desires. So if the desire to destructive, for instance, if they are expressing this desire by messing things around, their parents may probably get upset.

Because children always feel more in control when they are playing. They always feel helpless because they depend on adults through everything. The little control they have on their own life makes them feel uneasy and anxious. However, they can control the world they play. They can control which toy to play and they can construct something without the help from adults, which makes them feel more in control. It's a safe way for students to explore certain urges and desires that are not acceptable. For example, destructive behavior. If children break or mess up things in-house, adults will probably be upset. However, by acting out destructive behavior in play, this is acceptable without making their parents angry. For example, we often see children building towers and smacks", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "041", "audio_file": "1_20.wav"}}

The first one is that play helps children feel more in control, since small children have to depend on adults, so they often feel helpless, uneasy and pretty much anxious. But when they play, they can be in much control. They can decide which toys are going to play and how to play with it. Sometimes they take building blocks and make a building block of them and without any help. And there are reasons that play gives children the same way to explore such urges and desires. For example, kids may take the urge to be destructive, so being destructive during play, their parents won't get upset, just that you build a building and destroy it. Like some kids will build towers, smash it all down. And there's two reasons the speaker presents to explain the theory that play is a more healthy way to develop children.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "041", "audio_file": "1_21.mp3"}}

One is, I really have the people, especially the kids, to get rid of or overcome the feeling of being very helpless. People, especially the kids, when they are young, they really don't have control over everything. Their parents decide what they will eat, what they will wear, what kind of family they can play, so they feel they don't interact. They are not in charge of anything. They have to listen to everybody all the time. But really, they don't want to stay in that stage all the time. But by playing games, they feel they are the director and they are in charge. They can commend all the toys, how they should be moved and played with. Second of all, they really give the kids different ways to test their curiosity. As taking the being destructive, as an example, human are very curious. They really want to test out how to be destructive, but that always mess up and make their parents upset. They don't want to do so.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "041", "audio_file": "1_23.wav"}}

It's very good for their emotional health. The first reason is that play helps children have more control on their own life. For example, children have no control of their own life in real situation. They depend on adults and others for almost everything. But when they play, they decide which play they can choose. They can construct things as their desire. So they don't feel helpless anymore. Second example, the professor gave is that play gives children a safe way to explore certain address and boundaries. For example, curiosity is the children nature. So children would like to start to break things in the room to explore the boundary. But parents are upset with their kind of behavior. So when they play, the problem is solved. They can smash things down and destroy things without disappointing anyone, because that's allowed in a play.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "041", "audio_file": "1_24.mp3"}}

Why playing is beneficial for children's emotional development and first reason is that children can feel more in-country because they often feel helpless due to their dependence on adults to decide what to eat and what to wear. And let me feel uneasy and anxious, but during playing they can decide a lot of things like which toy to play with and how to play with their choices. And they can also build up some things without help from their parents. Secondly, playing offers them a safe way to explore the world and to satisfy their urge to destructive something, to distract something because they often break things down when they get too curious about the things and their parents may get upset. However, during playing they are allowed to do that because for example it's common to say that children always mash down the towers, you build by some blocks and they can smash down things without help.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "041", "audio_file": "1_25.mp3"}}

Firstly, children we all know that they just don't have a lot of control in their lives. They feel helpless. So when they are playing, they feel more in control of their life. Children usually depend on doubts to decide when to eat, so sometimes they feel anxious because they have little control of their life. But if they are playing, they feel they are more powerful. They have control of the world of play. They can decide what kind of toy to play with and how to play with a toy. For example, they can build a building, construct a building with no help from adults. And the second benefit for children is that they have a safe way to explore some desires that are not acceptable by the society. For example, children naturally want to destroy something. They want to explore the destructive behaviors. But if they do this in the real society, in real life, parents will get upset. So they can do this when they are playing. For example, they can build a tall tower and then just smash it down with this destructive behavior. But there's no harm.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "041", "audio_file": "1_26.wav"}}

The first one is children could feel in control because in children's life, when they're small, they often feel helpless. Parents are the persons who decide what they eat, what they wear. They have this dependency on their parents and it might make the children anxious. But in play, they are in control of what toy to play and how to play it. For example, they can choose things and to build construct a building with it. The second way is children can have a safe way to explore some urges that might otherwise be unacceptable behavior. For example, in home, if they break something, they're curious, they just want to feel what it's like to break something. When they did it, when they do it, the parents will be upset. But in play, for example, still in the building, if they break it, they have quenched their urge, but it's not harmful in any way. They have a safe way to do it.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "041", "audio_file": "1_27.wav"}}

Playing makes children feel more in control. Small children usually are dependent on their parents. Their parents made decisions for them like what to do tonight or what to eat today. But this will make children feel anxious, uneasy and helpless. During the play, they can make their own decisions of which toy to play or what things to construct. Second, playing is a safe way for children to explore their urges. Young children all have destructive urges, but they can't actually break things in real life because their parents will be upset. But they are all naturally curious. So during the play, they are allowed to be destructive. You can usually see how beautiful they are.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "041", "audio_file": "1_28.wav"}}

Because at that period it was very dry and hot. And during the drought sunnippers can just search for the water resources.

It is really rare to find so many points from the same species in one place like this. Many scientists believe that the reason the birds flocked together at this lake was because there was a drought and the lake was also of fresh water.

For example, the disappearance of Australia's Thunderbird is a good example. Thunderbirds are quite big and they can't fly and they became extinct 35,000 years ago. Scientists discovered lots of their bones all in one spot near a nation dry up the river. The explanation for this was the climate change in Australia caused this. For animals who were flocked around the last remaining water source in order to survive. But if the drought is too long, the river will eventually, the water source will eventually dry out and animal will die accordingly. And in this case, when the river could support the birds, this bird to survive for a while, but the drought was too long.

For example, Thunderbirds in Australia died out 35,000 years ago, and most of the scientists believe that it's a climate change that caused this extinction. The evidence in that researchers have found numerous Thunderbirds bombs at 35,000 years old all around what initially even that dried up long ago. It's really real to find so many bones for one time in one same place. And here comes a hypothesis. During a long dry period with no rainfall, these birds flocked up at this lake, which was one of the last few remaining of a fresh water, and they survived there for a time. However, the drought lasted too long. The lake eventually dried up, and these birds gathering there eventually died.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "042", "audio_file": "1_06.mp3"}}

They lead very interesting evidence because they find a 35,000 in just one spot around a lake. And the suggestion was that the change of climate which make the weather dry and there's no rain for during that time, which caused the dry up of that lake.

He gave us an example to illustrate that. The sounder birds, big birds, lived 35,000 years ago in Australia, and the climate change in Australia lead to their extinction. The researchers found big birds' bones in dry up lakes in Australia, and the explanation to that is there was a long dry pure rate at that time, and the lake was one of the last water source during the drought. So, the big birds moved together to the lake in order to find enough water. However, the drought continued for a long time, and there was not enough water for the birds.

The example is related to a bird called thunderbirds, which lived 35,000 years ago. New evidence has shown that numerous buns were found in one spot near a dried up lake in Australia. Scientists tend to believe that they die as a result of a dry out, because if there is no much rain for them, the creatures are tend to visit places that contain some water during a dry out. But if still no more rain could add up to the water in the lake, then all the creatures are going to die. So the thunderbird success served for some time, but eventually gets extincted.

So scientists believe that the only explanation of this is climate change in Australia.

And they normally would swim above the seaweed to protect the seaweed from being harmed by the other plants. For example, if there's a plant which blocks the sunlight, they will actually remove them or eat out the plant.

There are two examples made in the class by the professors. The first example is dandelfish, and they're like eating a specific type of seaweed. So they normally protect it by swimming about and around it, so that it would ensure healthy growth of the seaweed. For example, if there's plants growing too high and they block the sunlight for the seaweed, then dandelfish is going to bite down the extra parts of the plants so that there's enough sunlight for the seaweed.

But for some animals, they spend a great deal of time to take care of their food, like farmers. They keep an eye on their plants or their animals and let them grow until they become mature food resources for them. The first example is about dasseling fish, which is a special kind of seaweed, which eat a special kind of seaweed. And wherever this kind of seaweed grow, there will be a dassel fish swam above it. And if other plants have grown over it, it blocks the sun. The dassel fish will remove them by bite them. So the plants are going to grow really healthy and become reliable food resources for this kind of fish. The other example is about a black ant that feed on tiny insects called alphas. This kind of alphas produce sweet liquid that the black ant wanted to eat. So in order to protect insects, they will guard them from other animals and also they even help them to raise their young.

For example, they would bat off the tips of the plants that are blocking the sunlight from being contact with seaweed. And by protecting their food, they can always have a supply of food ready to eat. Black and also cultivate their own food, which is aphid.

There are two examples to illustrate this concept. The first is a kind of fish who mainly eats on a kind of seaweed. They will actually protect the seaweed from being overshadowed by other plants, so they will have enough food to eat at the seaweed grow. And the second way is that animals will tend to cultivate themselves, animals by themselves. For example, kind of ants who feed on aphids, they would actually guard these aphids from being eaten by any other animals and even feed aphids themselves. So the aphids will then constantly produce liquid at a reliable sort of food for the ant.

The second benefit is that the forest fire can turn a poisonous and toxic environment into a beneficial one. For example, certain trees are harmful for the young beetles and keep them away.

The professor uses two examples to support the theory. The first example is that it's about wild turkeys.

Wild turkeys will wait at the edge of the wild fire and then catch insects. They're fleeing out. It's much easier for it than pecking on the ground.

It would be easier for the predators to find their food. Because when the forest fire happens, old animals will run away or fleeing, and the predators would be easier for predators to capture those animals. And if they are hiding, it would be difficult for them to find them. But if they are fleeing, it would certainly be easier. The professor had an example of an animal that captured insects. When the fire happens, the animal was just a way to capture the insects that got fleeing. And the second point that the professor made is it would be better for the young animals to grow in such an environment. Because there is a poisonous tree which are really bad for the beetles.

First, the example of wild turkey. While there is a forest fire, praise run away from these fires naturally. And for example, wild turkeys can see insects running away and it is easier to catch insects that are running away than pecking on the ground to eat them. So, wild turkeys go towards these forest fires to catch the insects to eat them. And second, beetles find certain trees poisonous to live in. They have certain chemicals that they cannot withstand.

Besides, there are also best places for young animals to grow. Because, for example, there's a tree which is poisonous in order to protect from the beetles.

First, forest fire could make predators easier to find food. Because when there is a fire, all those animals in the forest would flee out of the forest to keep away from the flames. At that time, animals like wild turkeys would wait at the edge of the forest fire to seek for and catch those animals which run out of the forest. This is easier for them to get food. Then catching them directly on the ground. Secondly, forest fires could help younger animals to get a more suitable environment to develop themselves. For example, there are some certain types of trees which are poisonous or dangerous for beetles. And after there is a forest fire, these types of trees would die so that beetles could lay their eggs in this forest and use them as nutrition to help them to grow up their own kids.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "044", "audio_file": "1_06.mp3"}}

However, to other part of animals for its fire may be beneficial to them. There are two reasons for my point. The point of the first one is that there may be much more easier for those animals as a predator to catch their prey. For example, those insects are fleeing that are easily to be caught by those wild or turkey rather than when they are hidden in the grass or herbs. Additionally, some animals can find a good place to develop their young, whereas they cannot develop their young before.

Her new romance, Lena, has a completely different schedule with her. She likes to go to bed early around the woman prefers doing things in the night. Basically, there are two options for her. The first is to change her own daily schedule and get more things done in the morning. The second is to go to the library and start the year so that she won't bother her friend in the night. I guess the first option is better for her because, you know, in this way, she doesn't have to give up the convenience of her role. She can still have the comfortable desk and cheer and use her books and notes right in her role. Besides getting up and going to bed early, it's kind of a more healthy schedule for her.

The first one is to make it easier for animals to find food, because fleeing animals are much easier to catch up than they normally are when they are hidden. For example, kind of turkey are always waiting at the end of the burning forest to wait for the running animals. It's much easier for them to catch up these animals. The second one is to provide a place for the young animals to live on, because fire can make an otherwise harmful environment more suitable. For example, kind of trees can secrete substance that keeps beetle away, because this substance is poisonous. But after a fire, beetles are seeking out these trees, because these trees have been dead, so they are not being hurt by these trees.

Then the first benefit is that it's easy for predators to find food. And we all know that forest fire will force all animals to run out of the forest to to avoid fire. And by doing this, while Turkey can go to the edge of the forest fire and wait there to catch insects which are running out of the burning forest, which makes it much easier to catch than the normal. It is that it can provide good place for good development, take the beetles and then pull. Some trees are very poisonous for beetles development.

The first benefit is that this will make it easier for certain fish to capture their prey. Take an electric eel as an example. When the eel comes into contact with some other fish that he wants to eat, it will send out a very strong electric current to shock and paralyze the fish so that the fish become immobilized and cannot swim away so that the eel could eat this fish at its leisure. The possibility to generate electric current also helps fish to navigate around the ocean environment. Take the knife fish as an example. The knife fish can create an electric field around its body. When it comes into contact with some other obstacles or barriers in the sea, like a rock nearby, there was sense of disturbance in their electric field and then know that there is something out there so they will avoid crushing into that rock and swim away.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "045", "audio_file": "1_01.mp3"}}

The first reason is that people may have a better understanding, better memory if they have already known some previous knowledge of understanding. For instance, in classical music, if people know nothing about classical music, it may really difficult for them to recall details after a year. They may not remember which pieces were being played and older of the performance. People who know a lot about classical music and for those who have been studying and playing classical music for years, it would be much easier. Another reason is that people will have a better memory of something that's unusual or different.

For example, if you ask to buy other fans a year later, you might not remember a lot of details. However, if you already studied and played the classical music, it will be much easier for you to recall what happens details during the concert. And the second aspect the professor talks about is that people tend to remember those which are quite unusual from others.

But on the other hand, if you study and play if you studied and played classic music for several years or say many years, it'll be probably very easy for you to recall the details of the concert. And another reason is that people might remember things better if the piece of memory is unusual or different from what they already know.

And first is that if we have previous understanding of something we try to remember, it would be better for us to remember you very well. And the professor mentions that use classical music, for example, if we have no knowledge of all the classical music, it will be hard for us to remember the details that we may not know what piece was played on the order and so on. And secondly, if we have been studying classical music for many years, it will be easier for us to recode. Secondly, the professor mentions that if there is something unusual or different from what we try to remember happens, it will definitely help us to remember it. Such as if you have a big class that with over 100 students, it will be probably for you to easily remember someone is tall or smart because they are very different.

The first is that we have previous understanding about this thing. For example, the classical music concert you went on. You may not remember any piece of the music and also the player if you do not know classic music at all. However, if you already learned several years of practice several instruments before you entered the concert, you may remember a lot later on. And the second reason is that you may remember things because they are different or are you wrong. For example, you entered a class that has more than 100 students in this class. You may not remember all of the students, but you can remember a person that really are you wrong or exceptional. For example, you may remember the boy who is exceptionally tall and you may remember the girl who are exceptionally intelligent.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "046", "audio_file": "1_07.wav"}}

The first one is that people could remember better if they have a previous understanding. For example, when attending a music concert, if a person doesn't know anything about music before, he might not be able to record details like the pieces. They played and stuff like that after the concerts. However, a person studying music could really cause them more easily. And the second one is that people could remember things better if the things are somewhat unusual. For example, in a class with once hundred students, people will remember those persons with distinct from each from others, like especially taught or intended.

If you already know a lot, all you have been studying and playing classical music for many years, it is probably going to be either to record the details data.

You won't remember what pieces were played and what's in treatment has played in that music. And also, but if you have some knowledge, for example, you have playing or studying for it for several years, you can call it much easier.

First of all, previous knowledge can help with better memory. For instance, the professor mentions classical music concerts. If you didn't know any knowledge of classical music, it will be difficult for you to recall the details of such as the pieces of the concerts a year later. But if you have studied classical music for long time, it will be easy for you to recall the details later on. Also, a new role or different attributes can help to remember.

For example, what's the order of the pieces? However, if you study or play on the classical music for years, you can recall all the details after you heard the music.

The first is, people tend to remember things better if they have the previous knowledge and she used an example of going to a classical concert to illustrate on this point. If you do not have any background on the classical music and many years later you may not remember the details on the concert. Like you don't know what pieces are played and what the author they play the music. However, if you know the background, it's easier for you to record the concert. And the second explanation is that people tend to remember something unusual better. Like if you have attended class with a lot of students, you will remember students with special points. Like if the boy is quite tall, you tend to remember him many years later.

As an example, if you went to a classical music concert, and without any knowledge about classical music, you probably will not actually remember anything about the concert, especially for the details. As an example, well, actually, if you're asked about what happened in that well concert a year later, you probably will not tell people about the order of the orchestra. Also, however, if you know something about classical music, and you have been playing a classical music instrument for years, you probably will always remember these details.

The professor has provided us with two possible explanations. The first explanation is that people may remember things better when they have previous knowledge. So imagine if you are in a classical music concert, but if you know nothing about that without any background knowledge, when and after you may not recall any details about the music concerts, but if you have already known a lot about classical music, for example, you have studied playing music for several years, it would be more easier for you to record details like which pieces they had played, which order they had applied in.

It might be because we have a previous knowledge of the thing we are trying to remember that will make the memorization much easier. For example, if you go to a classical music concert without any knowledge of classical music and a year later, one asked about the details of the concert like what pieces were played and the order of the pieces that were played. We are not able to recall anything. By contrast, if you have been studying classical music for years, it would be much easier for you to recall the details of the concert. And the second reason might be if there is something on Europe about the thing we are trying to remember, it would be easier for us to recall it.

Say, you are going to see a classical music concert. If you don't know anything about it beforehand, if someone asks you like one year later, you wouldn't be able to remember the piece and in which order the piece applied. And if you are studying and practicing music for like a lot of years, it will be easier for you to memorize. Another explanation is that unusual things happen. Say, you are in a very big class. There are 100 students in it. You wouldn't be able to memorize all the students, right? But you could recall some students that are very special, like, for example, a man that is exceptionally tall or good, that is very intelligent.

The first reason is, people tend to remember things which they have previous knowledge about them. The professor uses the classical music concert for example. If you go to see the concert now, if you know little about them. You can hardly remember any details after one year, but if you have been studying the music for a long time and you know a lot about this concert, you can easily recall any detail in this concert. The second reason is that people are more likely to remember unusual things. The professor takes the universities class for example.

For one thing, the domestication of animals just provides more consistent and more reliable food sources. Before hunting, sometimes people are able to catch animals and can meet, and other times they don't. So with the domestication of animals, there will always be the food meat sources available. So we'll never people need meat, they can just kill the goat and get the meat. And for another thing, domestication of domesticated animals can provide another supply other than meat. It still takes a lot of goats as examples, they can actually provide milk, and people can collect milk and process it into other products like yogurt or cheese, and they can store it in this way.", "output": "3.7分", "meta": {"problem_id": "047", "audio_file": "1_02.mp3"}}

The first benefit is that Asian people got a reliable and constant source of meat. In the past, when they hunted on wild animals, sometimes they could not catch them, and therefore they did not have available meat resource. However, with the example of domesticated animals, like goats, which is easily controlled, and could accompany people from move to place to another place, people get meat available now. Moreover, another benefit is that it provided people a variety of food of other than meats.

However, about just 10,000 years ago, people know how to domesticate animals. And these domesticating animals have lots of benefits. Firstly, it was kind of reliable and consistent food. This kind of food can always make people enjoy food anytime in the moment. Like the goat, you don't see them, and they will just follow the human beings. And secondly, the domesticating animals can supply variety kinds of food that humans want, not just meat. But live a goat. They are also produced milk that people can just drink for. Or they can use the milk to process the other food by yogurt or cheese. And this food is better for store.

While the wild animals were unreliable, sometimes people were not able to catch them or find them. For example, the ghost, which is one of the first domesticated animals, they were easy to control and usually would be raised in herds. They will accompany people from place to place. So whenever people wanted to eat, they could just eat the goats because they were always available. The second benefit is that those animals will be able to provide additional food resource while the wild animals could only provide meat. For example, the goats, they were able to produce milk, which the human beings would be able to collect and drink it.

The first benefit is that it provides early humans a more consistent and reliable source of meat. When people hunted for meat, sometimes they were able to capture one, but sometimes there wasn't. So, that was not reliable. And I take the goals for example, which is one of the earliest animals that was the masses created by people. They were easy to control, so they were able to accomplish and to move from place to place, whenever people needed meat, they could eat the goals. And secondly, domestication means that it could provide a variety of food products other than meat. When people hunted, they only got meat. But now, for example, loud ghosts produce milk. So, people could just collect milk and drink it. They can also produce processed milk to other products like yogurt and cheese, which are easier to store. That's how the professor explained.

Well, early humans eat meat, they hunt, but 10,000 years ago, they began to domesticate, raise the animals, because wild animals are not reliable meat source. And one of the benefits is that it can provide more reliable source of meat. Let's take ghosts as an example. Ghosts are always raised in harps, and they are very easy to control by one people. And that is the shepherd. So whenever people want to eat meat, the ghosts are always available for them to eat. And the other benefits is to supply the variety of food more than meat.

So they will provide constant food source for people. Whenever they want to eat meat, they can kill a goat. Second, it will supply people with a wide range of food.

The first reason is that the domestic animals provide constant and reliable source of meat. When people were hunting for food, sometimes they can catch animals, or sometimes they cannot. Therefore, hunting cannot provide a reliable food source. But the domestic animals like goats are easily controlled herds, accompany people when they travel from place to place. Therefore, people could always have meat. The other reason is that the domestic animals provide new types of foods. For instance, the goats can produce milk, which can be collected or drink by human beings. And also, they could be processed into being yogurt and cheese.

The first one is that domesticated animals can provide humans with dependable and consistent source of food. Because hunting is risky and not reliable. For example, sometimes the way you would escape and the human would not find food. For example, goats are easily controlled and organized into herds, led by a shiver. And they accompany people whenever they go. So they are always on demand and can be useful food.

The yellow coat very greatly and was uncontrollable. Sometimes they succeeded at the time they felt. Who is domesticated animals? They could have kind of meat whenever they like. For example, goats could be easy controlled and they could follow people anywhere so that they were always available for consumption and for food. So the benefits is that domestication of the animals could provide more than just meat. Again, as I mentioned, when early human hunted animals, they only got meat with domestication animals to get more.

The first of all is that animal domestication provides the consistency resources of meat. So it actually stops the problem of the uncontrollable amount of wild animals. The professor talks about the domestication of goat in the early ages. So when the shepherd are moving around, they can actually eat their meat they can domesticate. Secondly, domestication of animals supply a variety of food other than meat. So take the example of goats again. In addition to meat, the goat can actually provide milk in other products that is addition that was actually made from milk like yogurt and cheese.

So one benefit is that they domesticate animals could provide more reliable and constant source of food. So for example, she talks about gals that were easily organized and controlled in the herd. And they usually accompany people whenever they went. So that this source was always available and whenever they wanted to eat, they could just eat it. And the other benefit is that these domesticated animals provided a variety of foods other than meat. So for example, she talks about the same live goats that could produce milk.

But when they begin to domesticate animals, they feed and raise them. There are two benefits of them. The first one is to provide a consistent reliable source of meat. When hungry animals, they can find and catch, but other times no. But when they domesticate animals, the meat will always be available. Like a ghost, a ghost is the number one to be domesticated and they are easily controlled and organized and hurt by persons. So when they need it, they always to be available. The second one is to supply a variety of food and meat. Because they hunt for animals, the food is meat, but domesticate animals are able to supply meat other than food or products like a ghost. Like a life ghost produce milk and they can process milk to yogurt and cheese and begin this door. Well, I think that's two to expect.

The first one is that animal domestication provides a more consistent and reliable source of meat for humans. Back when they were hunting wild animals, sometimes they find animals to eat, but sometimes they don't, so it's not less consistent for early human beings. For example, if you raise a herd of goats, the meat of the goats are always a constant source of meat for the shepherd. And the second example is that animals sometimes supply food other than meat. For example, milk goats also supply milk for human beings and they could also possess milk into yogurt or cheese, which are easy to store, other than drinking the milk. So there are more ways that animals benefit human beings.

Well, the first benefit is that, well, of course, the domestication could provide humans with reliable source of meat. You know that, well, animals could not provide humans with reliable source, then sometimes people could not find or catch them. Well, for example, goat is the first domesticated animal, and it could be a walk in hers and accompany people. So whenever people wanted to eat meat, well, of course, they could have goats to eat them. And the second benefit is that, well, the domestication could supply another source of food rather than meat. Well, also take goats, as example. Actually, live goat produce milk, and of course, people could drink milk, and of course, people also could transfer milk to yogurt or cheese so that they could just do carry, and it is more, it's more non-preserved for humans.

The first benefit is that they could provide consistent meat resources. The second benefit is that they could provide other and other extra products. The first benefit is the example of a girl as we mentioned. The girl is the first domestication animal that people had to re-race. And while the girl, the people could use it meat as they could. People who just hunted for food, they were not reliable sources. Sometimes they hunted food, but sometimes they're not, so they would just get a start. But with the domestication, they could have reliable, refered resources. About a second benefit is that the girl can produce other extra products, like the milk of them. And this product can also be beneficial for humans, so women could take them as food too. This is the other benefit.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "047", "audio_file": "1_19.wav"}}

Before animal domestication, people usually hunt for wild animals to find meat, but sometimes they cannot find them because wild animals are not easy to hunt. But after domestication, people always have meat available to them. For example, goats are domestic animals that are easily controlled by people. Whenever people want to eat meat, they can just eat those goats. And another benefit coming out of domestication is that it will provide a variety of food rather than meat. For example, goats can produce milk when they are alive.

First find that it could provide more consistent and reliable sources of meat. To draw comparison, if you try to hunt animals, you can now guarantee you are able to catch your prey every time. So this source is not reliable. But the domestication could provide you with food, such as meat always available. For example, if you domestic goats, this sort of animal is much easier for you to control and they could even be moved from place to place. And usually, a shepherd would take on this role. And second, it could provide you with a variety of food sources other than meat. The food products, including the milk, gather from goats. And you could collect it later on to drink it.

In the first example, goats were the first kind of animal that were domesticated by early humans. They were easily to be controlled and organized by shepherd. So goats always kept in a herd and could move with people so that people could have reliable source of meat to eat when they were moving. Another benefit of animal domestification is that it supplied food other than meat so that early humans had a variety of food to choose. In the example, goats produced milk so that people could drink.

So the first point, I think the animals will be able to be domesticated, then they can always go to provide all the content sources of meat for all the humans, because when the humans are just catching some wild animals, sometimes they can not really successfully catch all the animals. So example, a branch, when some ghost will be domesticated, then they can be easily controlled and organized by some people. So they are really moving around the ghost they can accompany them, and the people that want to eat meat, they can always eat the ghosts, so they are always available. At the same point, in the event of the domesticated animals, they can provide a variety of food for all the people other than the meat. So if they go to some live ghosts, they can really produce some milk. So all the people, all the eating people, they can just go to collect and drink all the milk from the ghosts. So what they are doing, then they can turn all the milk from yogurt or cheese, they can be sold by all the humans.

While people were still hunting, sometimes they were able to catch animals, but sometimes they were not, so it's not very reliable. However, the professor uses the example of goat. Ghost is very easy to control, and while people are more moving, they can accompany the groups of people, so whenever the people need meat, they can kill a goat to satisfy their need. Moreover, the domesticated animal can provide a variety of food products other than meat. Let's still use goat as an example. Goat can provide milk, and the milk can either be drunk or be processed into yogurt and cheese, which can be eaten by people.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "047", "audio_file": "1_26.wav"}}

The professor got a piece of mail that talks about kitchen renovation and how the floors being take part and to make the new one, but the thing is she doesn't own her own apartment, which this pamphlet is totally unusual. This list for her and then she threw it away in the garbage can. And the other effect is that it has negative effect on natural beauty of the environment. Let's say you are driving on the road and would be surrounded by beautiful scenery on the side of the road. And instead of appreciating the scenery, the billboard that is advertising gets you in the way.

There are basically two ways. The first is in that it may waste natural resources such as trees. For example, when the booklet is distributed to irrelevant consumers, then the consumers may just throw it in the trash. For example, I don't have my own place and I just rent a house. So the renovation booklet of kitchen is just useless for me. So then, when I was given this kind of booklet, I will throw it. The second one is, it will harm the natural beauty. For example, when you go outside for a mountain view and then you will see a huge board along the side with all kinds of advertisement. So you can fully appreciate the beauty and those boards of advertisement will block view of natural environment and the people will be distracted from appreciating the natural environment.

Since she doesn't have her own place, she rents a house, so it was no use. For her and for other people who also rent a house, they were just through the book in the ancient rush scenes. There was no need for them. The second one is that it may negatively affect the natural beauty. For example, there is a world passing through beautiful landscapes and mountains.

The information seems quite irrelevant and they just throw booklets away, which is a total waste of paper resources.

Okay, so, the professor talks about that advertisement may become useless for people, and it will cause the waste of natural resources. For example, the booklet she just received. The booklet she just received contains a lot of papers talking about how to renovate her kitchen. However, the professor herself does not own her place.

She also assumes that a lot of other people would receive the mail and just throw the book away, which is a total waste of the paper.

For example, when the professor got a mail regarding the kitchen renovation advertisement, that advertisement was in a big book which has lost lots of people and it indicates that lots and lots of people have been wasted for that advertisement and it is considering the people who does not own their own house and live in an rented apartment.

They have no right to redecorate kitchen. Second, advertising can have negative effects on natural beauty, because people can't fully enjoy the feel of a billboard, getting away, distracting them.

For example, Edward Messmann could be a waste of the natural resources by presenting to a group of people who don't have that need. For example, a company used to mail all the people who have the house about the kitchen renovation service. But it is not an impactful for those who rent the house in town for having a house with the kitchen. And so that mail book is quite a waste of the natural resources of the tree, which makes up so many ways, many pages of that book.

Firstly, this would be a waste of natural resources.

For example, the professor has just accepted some meals about little booklets. This booklet is about kitchen renovation company. The professor is renting an apartment. She don't have her own house. She do not need to rent her kitchen anymore. So this booklet is just a waste of resources. What's more, another negative influence is about the environmental beauty.

The first is it will waste a lot of natural resources. For example, the professor receives the mail about how to renovate people's kitchen. In this booklet, it contains a lot of paper, which means it will waste a lot of trees and paper. However, the professor rents her apartment, so she doesn't have such need. And also a lot of other people who don't have their own house will receive these mail. To them, this is useless. But they will just throw them away because they don't have such needs. And the second thing the professor talks about is advertising prevents people from enjoying the beautiful scenery of the environment.

For example, 13 whose women large groups can easily spot the large groups than to spot a small individual so that the whole groups will be eaten by whales. And the second disadvantage is that animals might have difficulties when they try to care for their young. Since a lot of them live together so it is really hard for them to find and identify their young. For instance, they might take care of others babies and their own baby may not be fat all the time.

One disadvantage is that animals living in groups are more visible and vulnerable to predators. Simply takes the sardines, for example. They just swim in groups and they are prey for some large animals such as whales. Although it might be hard for a whale to notice one little sardine, it is able to see a group of them and capture them for food. Another disadvantage talked by the professor is that living in groups that great barriers for animals to identify their own young and thus have them in good care.

The first is being visible to predators, because the group is so large, which makes it easier for predators to spot them. For example, a kind of small fish caught sedian. They live in the ocean, and the predator is a kind of ocean whale. Although for the whale, it's hard for them to figure out one sedian at a time.

The first disadvantage is that living in groups may be visible to the predators. For example, sardine is a kind of small fish and it won't be noticed by the predator if they were long. However, if they swim together in a group which are very noticeable for the predators, which makes them very vulnerable to be attacked. And the other disadvantage has something to do with the caring for the young. For example, beds, which are sometimes living together in the same case, are consists of millions of the beds. And when the mom, their baby went out finding food to feed their babies. And when they came home, they might end up feeding the babies of another mother bed, meaning that her own baby won't get feed at all.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "049", "audio_file": "1_05.mp3"}}

And the first disadvantage is animals living groups are more visible to their predators. And she uses sardines as an example. Sardines which live individually are not as noticeable as living in groups. And living groups means more vulnerable to their predators. One, sardines living groups, the most which are their petals, could more easily notism and so can petrodom at their foods. And the second disadvantage is caring for the young. The petal uses a kind of pet, millions of them living in a conference space. So it might be difficult for the mother bites to find their own baby bats. And thus, they might end up feeding another mother bite's baby bat. And which meaning their own baby bats might not get feed.

However, in the listening, the professor talks about two disadvantages of living in a group for animals. The first ones animals are sometimes more visible for predators when they live together. They often like to spot by the predator and vulnerable them. For example, the sardines are living really large amounts and with tiny size. Weals often eat them because it's easier for them to observe and capture with a group of sardines together. Another point is this advantage of living in a group is to caring for young. It is really difficult to identify your own children and sometimes mistake and identify their other babies. For example, the bats, there's millions of them live together so sometimes it's so crowded hard for the mom to find their own babies and feed other babies.

First, this would make them much more visible to the predators. In other words, predators would be much easier to spot them than if they act individually, which make them much more vulnerable to the outside environment. For example, the sardine usually acts as a group, and whales would usually eat them for food. The whales would not be able to notice them if there is only one sardine, but if they act collectively, the whales would capture them for food. And second, living groups make them difficult to find their own young. Chances are good, they are probably going to take care of the others of spring. The bats regularly live in caves with millions of them, which makes it very difficult for them to find their own baby. So the mother bats may feed the baby of other bats, leaving her own baby home.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "049", "audio_file": "1_08.wav"}}

Firstly, it can be more visible for predators to spoil them in a group. For example, settings always leave in group. And their predator whales will easily catch them if they are swimming in groups. Then if they are just keep along and leave in the video, that will be difficult for a huge while to catch a little study. It will be difficult for this mother to take care and feed their own young. Since there are too many young in such a huge group, it's hard for them to identify their own child. For example, bats always leave in such a big cave. And in this cave, they are about millions of bats. So it's really hard for this mother, bat to identify their own child.

However, well may not notice only one starting, but if they are living in group, it's easily to be spotted by well and captured by well. And another disadvantage is it will make them too difficult to find their young to feed on. And the professor uses an example of bats, like there are millions of bats living in the same cave. And sometimes the mother bats may find it easy. It's really hard to distinguish their own baby.

Imagine a good big group of animals versus individuals. Of course, it's easy to spot those big groups. For example, siding a kind of tiny fish and the primary eaten by the whales. If they are just a tiny individual siding, as we mentioned, it's really tiny. The whales are not easy to find them. However, if they move in a group, the whales are able to eat them over. Then they cannot survive. And the second one is related to caring for the young. If there are lots of individuals in the group, the moms are not able to identify their own children. So they might add up passing the food to the wrong babies. For example, a kind of bat, thousands of them live in the same case. It's really crowded. Once the moms get feedback, they are not able to find their own children and may pass the food to the wrong babies and their own children as their staff.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "049", "audio_file": "1_14.mp3"}}

First, you could be more visible in group to your predators. For example, the zadding fish. If you are a single zadding, you could hardly be seen by a whale. But if you swim in groups, it's more likely that you will be eaten by a whale in a hole. And second, the second point the professor suggested is that if you live in groups, you are less likely to find your own baby. The male of the bats live in the same cave. When the mother came back from finding some food, she could end up feeding others babies. In the end, her own baby will be starving. So that's a really sad story to talk about.

For example, sardines swim in groups and whales tend to eat them because they swim in groups and they wouldn't eat them if they were they swam individually because they are hard to spot when they're alone. Second, she explains that it is very disadvantageous for caring for young because it is hard to identify their own young, best living case together.

The first one is animals would be way too visible to predators. So, while a lot of individuals of the same species congregate together, they can be easily spotted and found by their predators. Sardians, which is a really tiny creature in the sea, is a good example. But a lot of sardians are moving together, they can be easily spotted by large whales. Another disadvantage is that it would be a big problem for parents to take care of their young. For instance, one million of bats are living in the same cave. It would be difficult for a mother bat to find which one is her own baby. So, when mother bats returns from getting food, the bat may end up feeding the baby of other bats.

The first disadvantage is that when living in growth, animals will be more visible to predators. The professor illustrates this statement by giving example of sardines. Sardines are small fish, but they swim in growth. That's why they are more visible to whales. If they swim individually, then probably whales will not discover them, but because it's swimming in growth, collectively, whales just bite them easily. The second disadvantage is the tearing for young, because there are so many young babies gathering together. It will be hard for a mother to find her own baby. For example, bats, millions of bats gather together in a cave. So if you really hard for a mother bat to find her own baby and feed her, then probably the mother bat will", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "049", "audio_file": "1_18.wav"}}

The first one is that the animals become more visible to the predators. Animal travel in large groups are more likely to be spotted by their predators, so in this way they become vulnerable to be cached. For example, sardine, which is usually small fish in the ocean, is unlikely to be seen on its own by its predators as well. However, the sardine travel in large groups, so it makes easier for the whale to catch them. Another disadvantage is caring for the young. When animals lick together, it has become hard for the mother animal to locate their own young. For example, millions of one kind of pet live in the same cave, so when the mother pet returns from food hunting, it is really hard for her to locate her own baby, so she might end up feeding the baby off another pet, which is", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "049", "audio_file": "1_19.wav"}}

The first one is they become more visible to the predators, and the second is some difficulty to carry on for the young generation. And the first example is vasodines, which is a type of smell, especially normally living in groups. And it was quite hard for the whales to capture them in just one single sardine swan. However, when this will be a larger amount, it's easier for the whales to capture them. And the second example is my best. You know, like, middle is the best normally living together. And this may be kind of like hard for the mother's best to find her own baby. And when a mother's bad just got some food, she may just feed the baby, which belongs to other mothers. And this may result in her own baby just didn't get any food, which is quite harmful for the whole generation.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "049", "audio_file": "1_20.mp3"}}

The first one is that they move, they are more visible to predators. Take satin for example, satin is a kind of small animal and whales eat them. Satins do not swim individually. Therefore, when they swim in groups, it's more easy for whales to spot them. Secondly, it's harder for moms to take care for young when they love in groups. Take bats, for example. In caves and moms will go out to find food. But after they come back with food, it's much difficult for bats to identify their own baby. As a result, they sometimes probably end up giving their own food to other babies. And their own children will be starving and will not be fat.

I should discuss some major kinds of this group living in advantages in animals. The first is that it makes them possible to predict us. When animals live individually, they are less likely to be seen by a predictor, but if they live in group, they are very very positive. Productive acts are exactly the same, which is written in battle worlds. When they live together in group, then we get more likely to be seen by the world and eaten, unlike when they live in singles. The second advantage is that in caring for a young person, they get either five-year-old young, when they live in group, they get better by taking care of other people's young animals. For example, there's this particular part that lives together immediately, and if a model goes to find out which you might not know a young and feel that you're...", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "049", "audio_file": "1_22.wav"}}

The first disadvantage is that an animal might be visible if they live in a group rather than being an individual. So there's this little vulnerable fish called the sardines. They're really small in the living of oceans. Predators like sharks or whales probably won't notice them if they go by singles. But they can really recognize them because they're in a such a big flock of hundreds or even thousands of them. So ended up, predators eat them super easily. An herb disadvantage is that you might not be caring for your own young. Because there's so many animals living in one cave, maybe you're caring for somebody else's. For instance, a kind of bat living caves in numbers of thousands. It is so crowded that mother bats find it hard to find their own babies.

Another disadvantage is that they may not be able to carry their youngs. For example, bats. A million of bats live together, so it is very difficult for a mother bat to identify its own young.

First, animals are more visible to predators' groups. Staying in a group can be easier to be spotted by predators than staying single. Therefore, they are more vulnerable to being captured. For example, the starting fish who stay in groups can be easier to be noticed and eaten by whales rather than individuals. Second, there are some disadvantages when caring for the young, because there are a lot of young in the group. Therefore, the animal might have difficulty in finding and identifying their own young.

When sardine fish act individually, it will be hard for the whale to spot them and will not even notice it, but it will be easier for the whale to see and capture a whole group of sardines. The second disadvantage is that it will carry, it will end up not be hard to carry for the young. Since they live in a large group, it will be hard to identify their own young and take care of other offspring. For example, the bats. The bats live in the same cave and is very crowded.

In the first point, it is called defensive way, which means animals use hard body structure to defend themselves. She gives an example of turtles. While some turtles got some hard shell to cover is back, which means it is a physical character, which is very hard for the predators to attack. And they also got some flexible tanks or legs, which can come in and out of the shell, which can make them feel flexible and protected by the shell. On the other hand, it is called offensive way, which means can keep the predators away from them. She gives an example of portipi, which means it's got a small body covered by a needle-like cues. And when the predator gets near, the cues will get loose into the skin, which means when the predators see the cues, and they don't want it to be heard by them, so they just walk away.", "output": "3.9分", "meta": {"problem_id": "050", "audio_file": "1_01.mp3"}}

The first way is called the defensive way. That is, they have body structure which makes it hard for predators to get close. For example, the turtle has a hard shell covering around their body, which is very strong and difficult to break. Also, they can pull their head down into the shell and also their legs can be folded. All of these will make it hard for predators to get close. Second way is called the offensive way which can keep predators away. For example, the pokilang with more body and a long sharp needle-like porous. When the predators get near, they will lose a porous and all the porous will be better into the predator's skin. Then the predators will get threatened. And get away because they don't want to be hurt by them.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "050", "audio_file": "1_12.wav"}}

The first one is called defensive adaptation and the second one is called offensive adaptation. A perfect example of defensive adaptation is a turtle. So basically a turtle has a very hard shell to cover all its important organs and also it also has a very flexible neck and forelegs that can draw back to under his shell for more protections. And so basically this kind of protection offers a hard physical shell or protective layer that prevent predators from getting them. And the second one is called offensive adaptation like a porcupine which is covered by coils. And when a predator is trying to attack this kind of animal it's going to lose the coils on the cover of his body and therefore stay in the predator's body and make them feel pain.", "output": "3.6分", "meta": {"problem_id": "050", "audio_file": "1_13.wav"}}

The first kind is called defensive protective adaptation. The body structure of the animal makes it hard for the predators to attack and get at them. The example will be turtles. The turtle's heart shell will protect all of its key organs. The shell is incredibly hard to penetrate, which makes it difficult to the predators to actually harm the turtles. The second kind is called offensive adaptation. It is to use the physical features to threaten an predator with physical harm. The best example will be porcupine. Porcupine are armed with needle-like quills that are likely to threaten an predator with physical harm.

There are two key points. The first key point is definition, adaptation, dictatory, turtle. For example, a turtle has a hard cell covering its back and the vital organs. And if it feels threatened, a turtle could fold its neck and legs into its heart shell so that it can all protect from its predators. The second key point is an off-site adaptation. For instance, a percupi has lots of shaped needles, like crease, which could scare its enemies to step back because they say how other predators are hurt by percupis, threatening growth, and they don't want to risk being treated in this way again.

Animals will develop a body structure that can make the predators feel hard together. For example, the turtles, they have really hard shell. This shell cover their whole back and also their internal organ. The shell is so strong that it can never be split, open or be broken. Also, the turtles have flexible neck, which will enable them to pull under the shell. They also can pull their legs under the shell. In this way, turtles will be protected. The second adaptation involves sensitive. Animals will develop a body structure that can keep the predators away. For example, the protopan, they will be able to thread the predator with their physical structure because they have this needle-like quilt. Every time a predator tries to approach them, they will lose the sharp quilt. Those quilts will be embedded into the predator's skin. In this way, predators will not be able to approach them again.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "050", "audio_file": "1_16.wav"}}

First of all, it's the defensive adaptations which animals can use to make it very hard for their predators to get to eat them.

The predators can't eat them at all. Secondly, it's the author's adaptations which will threaten the predators by some physical structure. For example, you're with the kind of animals which have thousands of long sharp needles like quills on your body.

The first is called the threatening display behaviors, which communicates warnings. It will do no harm to animals, but actually it can avoid fights between them. Professor took the bamboo, for example. When there are two bamboals, find the same books, and the one of the bamboals will give off some threatening noise or grounds to show that other bamboals he wants to own the food themselves. Then another bamboo will understand the messages so that it will give off the food. As a result, they can avoid the conflicts between them.

The first seed of fruit will steer and make some grunt noise, so the other will know it wants the fruit and may give up without a fight, so it will benefit both of them. They will be friendly display behavior after the fight. In the case of baboon, after they really have a physical fight, they may just reconcile by making some friendly noises and even give each other a hug, saying, oh, now everything is OK and we can make that now.

They just act as a warning, but without threatening. So the other bamboo room might give up the fruit.

There are external cues in day and night and an internal clock inside the animals themselves. They are both very important. Take flying squirrels as an example, they sleep at day and active at night. Then the researcher carry out an experiment that then without the exposure to the sunlight for nearly a month. And according to the result, they do have a regular pattern of sleeping and waking, which means they have internal clocks to regulate their activity cycle. But the cycle is not very precise, which can be half an hour shorter than before. So what will happen when they can expose to the sunlight again? Actually, the cycle has been shifted, which means they will wake up at the middle of the day.

The first is the external factor, which includes daylight, and the second is the internal clock inside the animal's bodies. And the professor elaborates on this concept using the experiment of flying squirrels, which is an eternal species. In the experiment, the squirrels were placed in a constant darkness, and according to the result of the experiment, they still have a regular cycle, which they sleep and wake up at a same time of the day. This was determined by the internal clock inside their bodies. However, the clock is now so precise that they may have half an hour shot each day, so at the end of the experiment, the squirrels actually wake up in the midday.

The first one is the internal clock inside the body, and the second one is the external factors, such as the sunlight. The professor used the flying squirrel to illustrate this point. When kept into the constant darkness for a month, the flying squirrel could still keep the regular partner of sleeping and waking. That is to say, they are determined by the internal clock in their body. However, the clock is not precisely 24 hours long. That is, it is one hour shorter each day. When the squirrels are not put into the sunlight, their clock has been greatly drifted. But once they are put into the sunlight, firstly, they cannot match up with normal hours. They could wake in the middle of the day. However, after a while, they could change into the normal ones. That is determined by the external factors, such as the sunlight.

It turns out that the squirrels continue to have regular schedules. They still wake up and sleep at the same time as they were before. However, during two college, it's not exactly precise. It's like half an hour short each day. So after amounts, when they're exposed to the light again, the squirrels turned out to have a shifted schedule.

Although the pattern is not 24-hour, it's kind of half an hour shorter than that. When they are exposed to sunlight after months of darkness, they start to waking up at the midday.

Internal clock and external factors, such as sunlight, take flying squirrels as an example. Some flying squirrels were kept in constant darkness for a month. During this period, flying squirrels still follow the regular pattern of flick and waking, which indicated that there were internal clocks inside animals. However, these flying squirrels didn't follow the 24-hour cycle strictly. In fact, they are following a cycle half hours for her, because no external factor fine-tuned their internal clocks. After a month, the cycle of these squirrels shifted a lot, and they were brought back to sunlight again. At first, the cycles of these squirrels didn't match up to their regular pattern.

The first is that animals do have an internal clock. In an experiment, flying squirrels were kept in constant darkness for months. It was found that they continued to follow their regular circle. It could prove that they do have an internal clock. However, this internal clock was not precisely, which was 30 minutes shorter every day. So, their circle had drifted a lot. The second factor is external cues, such as the alteration of day and night. When the squirrels were exposed to day later again, their activity circle had already shifted a lot. They will come up in the middle of the day, but after a while, the squirrel circle began to change. External cues adjusted their internal clocks.

The professor mentioned an experiment involved an animal called fly-in square root. These kinds of animals were active during the night and were sleeping during daytime. Scientists put them in an environment that is totally blocked out from sunlight. This environment shows that these square roots were able to adjust themselves to a certain part, which suggests that the inside clock do exist. However, the circle is not very precise. It's half an hour early compared to the square roots living in natural condition. And the time didn't match up as well. They always woke up in the middle of the day. However, during a short period of time, the square roots were able to adjust themselves as natural square roots.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "054", "audio_file": "1_20.mp3"}}

However, this internal clog is not as precise as 24-hour slump is half an hour earlier, so every time these squirrels wake up a little bit earlier.

So these squirrels were exposed to the daylight again, and the external environment adjusted their pattern, and brought it back to the regular schedule, which indicated that the external factors do play a very important role.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "054", "audio_file": "1_27.mp3"}}

Take the example of fly squirrels, which is a nocturnal animal. When they are kept under constant darkness, it still shows the regular pattern of sleeping and waking. So it shows that their internal control of activity cycle is functioning. But actually they are waking half an hour and an hour earlier each day. So a month later when they are exposed to the sunlight again, they are actually waking at the middle of the day. But they start to adjust their sleeping behavior according to the sunlight, the external factors. And gradually they are changing back to their original sleeping habit. That's supposed effect of external and infernal function.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "054", "audio_file": "1_28.mp3"}}

The professor gives example of the squirrel. This squirrel is a nocturnal, which means that they activate during the night. When they are exposed to the environment of the constant darkness of a month, they still follow the regular patterns of the nocturnal behavior. However, what is surprising is that when they are exposed in the dark, they always wake half an hour earlier than usual. And day by day, these patterns shifted. And eventually, when they are exposed to the light, they just wake up during the midday. However, gradually, their external clock just adjusts their behavior. And their behavior back to normal, that is, they are again nocturnal animals that follow the 24-hour activity cycle.", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "054", "audio_file": "1_29.mp3"}}

In an experiment, the flying scholars, which were not tunnel animals, were kept in constant dinos for a month. And they could continue to follow their regular patterns of sleeping and waking up, which means that they have internal clock. But the clock was not precisely 24 hours long, so the scholars would wake up a little earlier. Half an hour shorter, so they would wake up in the middle of the day. After a month, their biological cycle changed a lot. When they were exposed to that daylight a month later, they would wake up in the middle of the day. But after a while, when external crews, such as sunlight, they would adjust their behavior. And then they would go back to their 24 hour cycle because of their cycle was adjusted by external clock. So both internal and external clock", "output": "3.5分", "meta": {"problem_id": "054", "audio_file": "1_30.mp3"}}
