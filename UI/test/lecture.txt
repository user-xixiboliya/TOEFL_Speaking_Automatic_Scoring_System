<-NARRATOR:-> Listen to part of a lecture from a biology class.\n<-FEMALE PROFESSOR:-> Most animals, including humans, follow biological cycles that are 24-hours long.\nWhat determines these 24-hour cycles?\nDo animals have something like a 24-hour clock inside them?\nOr are biological cycles determined by external factors—like the alternation of daylight and darkness?\nWell, research suggests that the answer’s somewhere in between.\nAnimals do have an internal clock, but external cues are important too.\nTake flying squirrels.\nFlying squirrels are nocturnal—they are active during the night and sleep during the day.\nBut in an experiment, some of these squirrels were kept in constant darkness—they were not exposed to any daylight for about a month.\nDid the squirrels continue to follow regular cycles of activity?\nActually, they did.\nThey continued to have regular patterns of sleeping and waking.\nThis indicates that animals do have an internal clock which regulates their activity cycles.\nBut the internal clock is not precisely 24 hours long.\nInstead of following 24-hour cycles, the squirrels followed cycles that were about half an hour shorter than that.\nSo every day, they woke up a little bit earlier.\nWithout external cues—without sunlight to fine tune their internal clocks—the squirrels’ biological cycles drifted.\nSo, what happened when the squirrels were exposed to daylight again?\nWell, after a month of darkness—a month of waking up half an hour earlier each day—the squirrels’ activity cycle had shifted a lot.\nSo at first, their schedules didn’t match up with the normal day.\nThey weren’t active during the nighttime, as flying squirrels usually are.\nInstead, they were waking up in the middle of the day.\nBut after a while, the squirrels’ cycles began to change.\nGradually, external cues—the cycle of light and darkness—adjusted their internal clocks.\nSo eventually, they were brought back onto a normal, 24-hour schedule.
